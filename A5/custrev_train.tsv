3538	neg	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
1442	pos	also , the wma compression format is superior to mp3 , especially at lower bit rates , so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers .

1157	pos	i would put the hitachi up with the best ! .

2798	neg	2 ) scroll button / switch
2709	neg	the price is $ . . . more .
734	pos	it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .

1446	pos	the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface .

543	pos	i 've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures .
669	pos	the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .

950	pos	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
3183	neg	unfortunately , creative offered scant few pages of instruction , which meant that i was on own from the outset .
3260	neg	still has terrible software .
1077	pos	i decided to go with the diaper champ rather than the more popular diaper genie , because i didn 't like the idea of having to buy special bags .
3111	neg	the major reasons i didn 't give it a five are : one , i didn 't think the fine adjustment worked well .
3082	neg	the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rp ms of the speed settings were mentioned .
9	pos	what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e . , mp3s ) .
1814	pos	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n 't even gotten to all of them yet .
3564	neg	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .

2336	pos	i found that to be the most impressive thing about the ipod 'mini ' - basically for ease of use , and the feel it gives .
1900	pos	the 6600 ( t-mobile ) is the true 'world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from singular ) replaces it w/ 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 ) .

2168	pos	this really is a great little phone ; . its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny ! .
833	pos	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
1853	pos	4 . the build is just right .
1594	pos	bottom line : if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services , and are willing to deal with the possibility ( not the certainty ) of setup gremlins , by all means get the zen micro .
2196	pos	it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
2305	pos	and , with the ipods ' full volume up , all you have to do is adjust your receivers ' volume and your set , since the ipod itself acts as a strong amp lifer of its ' own .
2000	pos	one primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux , where soft modem drivers are hard to find , and don 't work very well .

835	pos	i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
2714	neg	my only complaint and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren 't as intuitive as they should be .
2109	pos	size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
385	pos	i like to take pictures when i go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso 's but i don 't really care that much , i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality .
1875	pos	few month ago , it 's very popular among my community .
1907	pos	a sony erickson may be the phone for you . . . but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price .
2004	pos	i will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward , although you do need an external smut server to use .

387	pos	i 'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera .
3598	neg	the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows . ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac . ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so .
1861	pos	the use of 65536 ( 16bit ) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
1193	pos	for the money , i 'm not sure you can do better .
3162	neg	there is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the `` knowledge `` database at linksys . com , and first tech support person i spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour , then gave me a web site address to consult -- that turned out to be the one i 'd already found during a search of my own .
1706	pos	the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
1229	pos	i recently had to run a 3/4 `` straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn 't even slow down .
1083	pos	all in all , this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price .
1447	pos	what i like the most : - small and solid feel .
3251	neg	it is the 'first generation ' of the player , and while i still agree that it is a great alternative to the ipod , i think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck .
323	pos	i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
312	pos	and so far , i 've been very pleased .
3625	neg	but if i installed either one of these norton products , neither works after installation ? .
1199	pos	i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router .
1986	pos	2 . take around 10 , 000 640x480 pictures .
3572	neg	features : really , there aren 't any features , unless you call the games a feature .
1410	pos	for the price i think this is a remarkably fun mp3 player .
811	pos	its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus .
1693	pos	the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily .
568	pos	so far the software for the pc works easily .
1908	pos	despite a critical start , this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do ( which is pretty lofty ) . . . does more than most . . . does it well . . . is dependable .
1536	pos	when i opened the box , i was shocked by the size of this thing . . . it 's tiny ! .
3451	neg	just don 't get drawn into t-mobile 's catchy rebate .
700	pos	this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
3264	neg	the touch buttons do take a little getting used to and i don 't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an `` enter `` key , but you get used to it and it isn 't a big deal .
485	pos	this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me , which is great considering i 'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting .
2227	pos	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; . see below ) .
2579	neg	the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .
3097	neg	shortly after i brought it , the plunging shafts started sticking .
1839	pos	6600 looks and feels nice .
3562	neg	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
393	pos	i 've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views .
427	pos	the camera res ponce is very quick .
750	pos	very simple to use .
1678	pos	it 's easy to use , and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch .
351	pos	i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe ( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card ) .
3621	neg	this is only a problem at night , during the day the screen is very easy to see .
2961	neg	3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .
3203	neg	the touch controls took a little getting used to but now i wouldn 't change it for the scroll wheel .
1748	pos	i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
3418	neg	secondly , in addition to the lag each time you give a command , it 's just not that easily use able on the go .
1881	pos	handset quality is great , as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality .
23	pos	it looks great - and is loaded with features .
1361	pos	it works well with my vip adapter , which is also a linksys .
3470	neg	the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react , meaning when i push the contacts button , it takes a while to load , this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone .
3019	neg	it seemed as if we were emoting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless .
879	pos	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
2863	neg	but the earbuds suck ! .
1513	pos	freebies you get : a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip , some thing very handy and useful .
1309	pos	even though you could get a cheap router these days , i 'm happy i spent a little extra for the linksys .
3013	neg	in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
1358	pos	i guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler .
2181	pos	i simply love this feature .
2523	neg	when the player was working it was great , but .
1625	pos	i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks available to me , but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill , concerts and programs being simulcast , npr , and on and on .
3607	neg	as with most headphones that come with any type of music player , i recommend throwing these into the nearest river , unless you like having hard , round pieces of plastic in your ears .
283	pos	this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
2558	neg	i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .
2497	neg	i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .
3053	neg	then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not .
132	pos	it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .
753	pos	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
367	pos	i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures .
3642	neg	this product has virtually all the same installation problems .
1905	pos	it films 10 second video , for crying out loud .
3588	neg	the battery issue is superficially a concern , but any reasonable solder-jockey ( such as myself : - ) can pop in a new one when the time comes ( based upon the plentiful info gained from a go ogle for 'ipod battery replacement ' ) .
1756	pos	one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
1094	pos	i also love that you can flip the device with one hand . . .
6	pos	its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
517	pos	the macro mode works well , although it takes some practice since the camera doesn 't clearly indicate when it can 't focus .
592	pos	on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
2784	neg	the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
272	pos	the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
2045	pos	i got this phone yesterday and didn 't find any problems with it yet .
3666	neg	avoid this product at all costs .
1009	pos	even though i never ventured into the cloth land , i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life ! .
2072	pos	in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
1742	pos	the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
2209	pos	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
941	pos	i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
3283	neg	the touch pad is over-sensitive , and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive .
3049	neg	the only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full .
2169	pos	this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; . it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
2625	neg	canon 's g3 does it consistently .
3696	neg	just the home version of norton internet/av has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with .
439	pos	the picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good -- but i was wrong ! .
2981	neg	but with a low price , comes lower quality .
2264	pos	i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous .
1545	pos	strong points : - design : small , comfortable , curved , and stylish .
1014	pos	i love this product ! .
642	pos	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .

1577	pos	on the fly play list creation , address book , removable storage drive capabilities , sound recorder , the list goes on people , this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies , it was like halloween all over again .
1611	pos	+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hard shell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +usb cable ! .
2713	neg	the only thing i don 't like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card , first thing ! .
1510	pos	looks and shape : i have a black one and the first time i charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool .
1989	pos	5 . check traffic411 . com for la traffic on the 405 .
2597	neg	can 't say whether i rec 'd an `` updated `` model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .
2801	neg	the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
3004	neg	what a junk .
3158	neg	i then tried to set up the router through linksys 's browser interface , but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation cd , i had little luck - i did manage to connect briefly , but the connection kept dropping , and with no idea of how to resolve that issue , i gave up .
2846	neg	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
1024	pos	it holds quite a few diapers , and pops them in quickly and easily .
1834	pos	i 've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and i truely love it .
738	pos	the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
2730	neg	navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .

2860	neg	well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .

3066	neg	yes , you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle , but then it is gone .
2267	pos	pros : large hard drive for the $ $ -- 20gb and 40gb are both affordable .
1075	pos	it is a bit difficult to get the unit open ( the advice to take it slowly is sound ) , but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute ! .
3716	neg	i did it and it was worse the second time around . . . unbelievable .
3131	neg	the wizard is particularly sinister .
244	pos	but canon never fails to amaze .
27	pos	the fact that this model would play jpeg slide shows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .
3730	neg	i finally got a free support number for norton through my usp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice .
1549	pos	you do get 1 more gb than an ipod mini .
394	pos	as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had simone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image appeared on the decently sized screen .
1715	pos	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
426	pos	this camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation .

942	pos	i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .
1492	pos	the file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use .
2612	neg	i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
3239	neg	the ipod mini is smaller and sexier , albeit limited in supported formats and the rio karma is a far better value .
2123	pos	- well-backlit keypad
1743	pos	the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
2330	pos	really easy to use .
1172	pos	can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain .
3233	neg	pc software that comes with the player is not as simple as i tunes but its not bad at all .
1129	pos	but i wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits .
1210	pos	it is currently permanently mounted ( 3 years now ) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot .
2356	pos	this is the fourth version of systemworks and the second version of internet security that i have used and it has always been a favorite .

1694	pos	it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel .

2871	neg	the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .

2875	neg	also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore `` the `` when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .

2958	neg	minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .

494	pos	i have been absolutely , completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities .

1887	pos	6 ) the phone is really wide , which seems to be a turnoff for many people , but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic .

2381	pos	and the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my lan .
2446	neg	after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( flor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them . the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .
1860	pos	the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary .

3740	neg	what disappoints me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec , if you want support , they 'll charge you a fee ! .
1683	pos	the greatest thing about the software ( in my humble ) is that it reads your cd info .
2484	neg	one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .
3087	neg	mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it ( and this is why i 'm giving it 4 , not 5 stars ) .
2329	pos	all the `` cool `` features of the mini , but with 20gb instead of 5 .
2866	neg	what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .

2297	pos	this is the best purchase i 've made in a very long time .

1162	pos	very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models .
3431	neg	1-a cell phone is to make calls , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you 'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
1209	pos	you 'll love it ! .
2813	neg	d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
2620	neg	about the only legitimate criticism from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
3248	neg	it had issues right off the bat , with freezing up , staying in 'shutting down ' mode , and just not functioning very well in general .
3754	neg	i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed ( mainly the slow processor ) , and then i couldn 't get the damn thing off my computer completely ! .
2655	neg	the only knock i have is that the flash is underpowered .

772	pos	i would recommend this product to anyone .
3624	neg	i have read the installation instructions for both nis 2004 and navy 2004 prior to installation , but still ended up with the same result . . . junk software .
3011	neg	the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warranty period is to expire .

3331	neg	the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to .
97	pos	it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .
1783	pos	we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .

341	pos	i did not conduct a rigorous test , but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras , and the canon won hands down .
667	pos	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
1803	pos	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .

2849	neg	it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n 't cover up the ac jack .
2664	neg	only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash .
3578	neg	there technical service isn 't helpful either ; . they just read what 's on their website and charge you $ 50 ( + toll fees ) to do it .

2653	neg	when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen -- cracked -- and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen , black and blue and purple blotches and streaks -- useless .
3687	neg	there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedious activation process , and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive .
2448	neg	on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .
3168	neg	the firmware has bugs too , so download and install the latest firmware from linksys .

3025	neg	for my first i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky .
2532	neg	the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie `` extras `` on them on the two occasions when i tried to do that .
2118	pos	the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .
2902	neg	this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; . and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .

1501	pos	most of the other players i checked dont have user serviceable battery .
1010	pos	being a very economical person , i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills .

3112	neg	i replaced it with a router raiser and it works much better .
1616	pos	i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster 2 go . . . . which is a subscription service , allowing me to download as much music as i want for a $ 14 . 95 flat fee .
3088	neg	i have noted that as you use the tool , sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention .
3322	neg	the included headphones suck , so get your own .
2175	pos	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
3487	neg	downside is the size of the phone , it is big for today 's standard .

3717	neg	basically , i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help .
2766	neg	i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n 't a big problem .
2320	pos	it all sounds great too .

600	pos	the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
2681	neg	this camera uses a lithium battery , i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient ; . because what if you are on vacation , where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station -- there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there .
2116	pos	i like the size and weight of this little critter .
2974	neg	creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .

258	pos	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
860	pos	one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
3375	neg	i thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time .
3105	neg	the speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool ( screwdriver or dowel rod ) to effect any speed change .
641	pos	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
2273	pos	games -- not really important , but exist ant
3186	neg	most of us just want to plug and play , not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options . . . like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing .
3363	neg	it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
970	pos	works great , no odor , and uses regular bags .
2260	pos	thank you apple ! . you make fabulous products .
3293	neg	last , i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this .
2554	neg	the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .
1460	pos	don 't worry this player rocks .
3465	neg	some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone , and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name `` the bar of soap `` which , it really is .
195	pos	the prints are beautiful ! .
1911	pos	i would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn 't for the fact that i would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone .
801	pos	a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
3550	neg	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
1936	pos	best phone i 've ever owned , period .
2173	pos	the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
2501	neg	also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 `` tv ) .
964	pos	overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
1099	pos	so i can 't tell you if diaper champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell , but it 's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby ! .
3690	neg	long reboots due to norton taking forever to boot .
2282	pos	other than the fact that one can 't delete a file directly from the ipod , the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use .
1787	pos	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
2759	neg	the cons are n 't really a big deal to me . . . except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files . . . no folder structure . . . and it 's based on the title of the songs . . . many of my songs where separated into folders ( on the pc ) . . . and a few had same titles . . . so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n 't have any that might be the same as another .
1581	pos	so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all .
1169	pos	both the on/off switch ( soft start ) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand .
3622	neg	the only problem is the battery life .

995	pos	it 's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers .

436	pos	it is amazingly small , it 's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera .
561	pos	get it , it 's woth every penny ! . ! .
1000	pos	and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did ! .
335	pos	the sd500 rivals the canon g6 in image quality .
1662	pos	this player is absolutely phenomenal , i haven 't had any problems , and if you 're worried you will have problems , i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways . . . i find the touch pad very easy to use , and i 'm surprised so many people have had problems .
479	pos	but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing -- great battery saver .
2828	neg	3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
953	pos	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
346	pos	all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd500 are both rich and color and high in detail , the user interface is awesome , the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time .
500	pos	the camera is solid , performs well , takes good pictures , and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder .
3441	neg	the `` movies `` last about 5 seconds .
2829	neg	navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
1543	pos	transferring music is a breeze . i don 't subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes .
3689	neg	from day one , we 've had hangups , crashes , glitches , continual reboots , long shutdowns due to `` cc app . exe `` program running which is a norton program .
40	pos	it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .

1429	pos	the sound is quite good , in terms of volume .
921	pos	the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on your sound quality , the sound might crack .
1113	pos	this is really a nice diaper pail .
3571	neg	also , not liking the gel case .
35	pos	the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .
889	pos	11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player

3549	neg	the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
2741	neg	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; . not sensitive enough at others .
2524	neg	first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .

2350	pos	anti-spam is good
90	pos	there are a lot of things i like about it .
2957	neg	i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the `` rigor `` of a business traveler .

2583	neg	i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! .
176	pos	you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .

1816	pos	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
84	pos	it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .
2735	neg	the only downside i see is that it does n 't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .

3100	neg	if the plunging action is critical to your work , look elsewhere .
3182	neg	the tech support is worthless too .

3274	neg	only slight negatives i 've had so far is that i haven 't been able to get it to accept any of my wav files yet .
395	pos	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $ 500 price tag and get a quality camera .
2786	neg	the interface used could be better designed .
1740	pos	all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .

2678	neg	a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy .
465	pos	the ss body is wonderful , feels high-quality .
3078	neg	not so nice things : - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing ( outside of a table ) - the 1/4 `` chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping
1230	pos	i could take 1/2 `` passes and it still didn 't skip a beat .
2174	pos	the battery life is amazing .

1998	pos	among my requirements for a phone were : good screen , decent camera , bluetooth , and gprs support .
1741	pos	great camera , great investment ! .
1254	pos	but , for the money it is a good machine .
148	pos	no matter the format .
3497	neg	i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
2272	pos	good sound -- plays very nicely , even though the stock headphones are kind of weak durable -- not the most durable because its mostly plastic , but very compact and sturdy

56	pos	and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! .

648	pos	bottom line . . . great product , unbeatable price .
1600	pos	white earbuds ( i replaced those with some shire headphones , big difference ) , a case , a stand , a clip ( which doesn 't really work ) , and a nice little zen micro bag .

786	pos	it has n't gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ) .
2594	neg	i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .
3591	neg	*the ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily .

1004	pos	it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor ! .

1568	pos	the player looks great , feels great , and sounds great .
2793	neg	i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year `` no questions asked `` replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous ! .

3237	neg	what i dont like : nothing much except headphones , belt clip design .

1830	pos	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .

2980	neg	the zen does n 't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; . even with third party software that `` creates `` folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .

1526	pos	initially , i was very impressed , after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this , i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright .

60	pos	progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .

758	pos	i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .

2017	pos	it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work well .
1053	pos	but like i stated , its better then a trash can , but i 'm not sure if its better then the diaper genie .
2779	neg	this product is too fragile for normal use .
3258	neg	the colors are a joke , and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad .
1407	pos	the package also comes with a usb cable , an ac adapter , a pair of headphones ( they 're okay until you get a better pair ) , a stand , and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in .
1828	pos	the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n 't played with it too much on manual .
3272	neg	they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware .
2800	neg	but for now it appears that this player does n 't play well with itunes .
216	pos	night mode is clear as day .
1403	pos	this is the mp3 player with everything i need . as long as it lasts me a good three years , i 'm satisfied .

2220	pos	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
596	pos	zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
2575	neg	after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .
69	pos	easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .
673	pos	working for 10 hours with it on `` shuffle `` totally rocks ! . ! .
2068	pos	here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of `` plastic-like `` ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
2027	pos	i never get dropped calls .

3038	neg	we resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the diaper champ for wet diapers only .
3104	neg	the depth adjustment was sloppy .
3235	neg	since zen does not have an external antenna it has some problems catching weak signals but it works .
368	pos	if you 'll only read the whole manual , you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
959	pos	playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .
967	pos	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
1968	pos	i did notice if you turn the phone on and off the os takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker .

510	pos	it really is the perfect travel camera , plus it offers the convenience of digital photography .
2944	neg	nothing but hassle with this company .
396	pos	moreover , apart from the plastic cable cover , the camera has a nice , solid feel about it , and it 's so tiny , i take it with me wherever i go .
3213	neg	this fixes some glitches such as the player freezing .
694	pos	price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
1550	pos	this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price .
2197	pos	great phone . . .
2203	pos	overall an excellent phone .
2920	neg	- the cover that came with it did n 't fit very well
2261	pos	the product i rate five stars ,
2234	pos	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable ! .
662	pos	actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
42	pos	i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vb files which i created with smart ripper .
5	pos	it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .
952	pos	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
2219	pos	it is extremely light and disappears in your pocket .
1147	pos	i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too .
1640	pos	the sound is bright and clear , the ability to store any mp3 's ( and not just apple-approved files ) is great , and i plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time .
246	pos	2 . battery life is over 4 . 5 hours , compared to about 2 . 5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikon 's .
1304	pos	the setup was very easy .
3277	neg	the little bag it comes with is cheap and useless .
1670	pos	it 's a great looking , easy-to-use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my sony mini-disc player .
3034	neg	but now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using freshener .
2136	pos	while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
2156	pos	this is the best phone i have seen .
1256	pos	for the person that uses the equipment every day , pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit .
2108	pos	it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
1871	pos	it 's oval and . . . nice .
1689	pos	this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features .
2390	pos	5 stars all the way ! .
614	pos	oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^
1901	pos	the latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of the states but still operates in many countries , excluding new zealand and australia .
3557	neg	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
1114	pos	i recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers .
1032	pos	i love this pail ! .
1664	pos	the radio works excellent in my area , i 'm not sure everywhere else .
2253	pos	long live apple , long live macs , and long live the ipod ! .
971	pos	so far ( 3 weeks ) , we 've had no problems with the diaper champ at all .
2844	neg	difficult navigation - i wo n 't necessarily say `` difficult , `` but i do n 't enjoy the scroll wheel to navigate .
453	pos	travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
22	pos	great quality picture and features .
2021	pos	it fits comfortably in my hand and pocket .
796	pos	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good . . .
819	pos	great price .
717	pos	- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
2191	pos	the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
987	pos	this is a must have product for all new moms ! .
2675	neg	the lcd screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones .
2359	pos	once installed , however , some of the functions do work ok ( disk doctor , one button checkup , and win doctor ) .
3543	neg	the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
1465	pos	i do give create to creative for their attractive design .
1716	pos	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
2135	pos	the fm radio is cool .

2046	pos	picture and video quality is ok .
1435	pos	record memos using the built in microphone .
1772	pos	the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .

1940	pos	all at the same time , and all without a hitch .
3512	neg	the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
3502	neg	the volume .
588	pos	it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
2047	pos	love the speaker phone .
3397	neg	my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices , but they also don 't last as long .
3735	neg	i see many other reviews that say the same . . . . stay away from norton , they don 't deserve you , or anyone ! .
3090	neg	the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged .
1259	pos	by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do .
1145	pos	this is a great deal , and i 'm elated with my decision to go with hitachi 's green machine .
379	pos	i still have my s70 because i like the wider lens sometimes , but in general , if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package , the sd500 is the only one you should buy .
3520	neg	poor visibility on the keys .
974	pos	the diaper champ is the best we found ! .
1216	pos	enjoy .
3092	neg	i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could get those big panel raising bits in it .
3247	neg	if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception , but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway , so you can take that for what it 's worth .
3474	neg	dont rely on t-mobile rebates .
3633	neg	buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer .
1180	pos	combine this with the excellent price we got in the gold box , and i 'm really happy .
137	pos	i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
3608	neg	because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unrepeatable 18 month battery .
289	pos	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
2665	neg	the sd500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months , and the lcd has been broken twice .
677	pos	it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
3499	neg	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
3534	neg	so loud , really , that it does n 't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
809	pos	it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
356	pos	this camera is bulletproof .
1785	pos	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
2077	pos	no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
2255	pos	very sturdy and strong .
3651	neg	almost from the beginning , liveupdate would not function .
3653	neg	when i finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month .
815	pos	overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
3435	neg	basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don 't and won 't need ( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc ) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
3585	neg	3 no voice recorder -- this has also become an important and popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesn 't have .
582	pos	all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
3639	neg	too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time .
1013	pos	go for the champ .
2610	neg	it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
3289	neg	it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it .
837	pos	plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
2886	neg	it also has unproven battery life .
2621	neg	the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
3739	neg	if you have no previous version of nortron security on your system , or nortron antivirus , the installation will go fine , otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up ! . the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation , even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly .
562	pos	i 've had it for a week now , do n 't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
3505	neg	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4 . 99 / mo . ) never works .
2935	neg	i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for reaping the damned thing .
2937	neg	2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc . ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .
2189	pos	not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .
2481	neg	mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .
947	pos	have had the player since xmas 's and love it ! .
1503	pos	another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable .
178	pos	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
3670	neg	then when i went to norton 's website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given , i couldn 't find a way to get one .
2885	neg	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n 't since with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , etc . like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
2544	neg	well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .
2593	neg	on several different occasions it has displayed `` no disc `` with a disc inside .
2889	neg	* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
2646	neg	when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
800	pos	the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .
234	pos	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
3133	neg	the box proudly displays `` securest ( tm ) `` `` wireless made simple `` `` one touch setup button `` `` easy start `` `` easy security `` `` easy everyday `` apparently linksys/cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial .
2994	neg	short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
2637	neg	it is made of plastic .
2929	neg	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc . creative 's online support was no help at all .
1720	pos	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n 't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
188	pos	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
3178	neg	now this router is not the cheapest on the market .
130	pos	also , it was only $ 39 . 99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .
442	pos	i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera , but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size .
548	pos	i , as many others , have waited for many years for the convergence of price , features , size and ease of use to hit that happy center point .
1301	pos	in addition it is very easy to setup .
3095	neg	i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table .
724	pos	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
2436	neg	i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n 't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .
1876	pos	it 's good .
2764	neg	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
3085	neg	i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much .
3703	neg	this is definitely one of those products , especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit .
1818	pos	i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
655	pos	i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic ! .
1791	pos	it takes great pictures .
705	pos	i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
1440	pos	however , if there was one thing i liked about the creative , it would be the car adapter .
1725	pos	the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
3015	neg	the cons , at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth .
1002	pos	this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great .
2033	pos	this way i never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones , i can get whatever i want .
877	pos	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
838	pos	ripping the songs , even with my 1 . 1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
2686	neg	the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet .
3469	neg	also the battery life isn 't great but it 's sufficient for my needs .
2111	pos	speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
3477	neg	2 ) phone is awfully slow .
1419	pos	the hard case they give with it must work well .
2023	pos	it 's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in europe are quite reasonable .
1966	pos	the interface is simple to use .
709	pos	i just bought this player today and i already love it .
3228	neg	i downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem , but it hasn 't worked .
2487	neg	the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out ! .
2042	pos	it is a multifunction phone , reception quality is better than the 610 .
219	pos	a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging -- - how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
309	pos	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
532	pos	don 't care about sunlight : it 's tft .
1328	pos	the card basically installed itself and the `` install wizard `` on the cd that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer ( with the 54g card ) and also a second computer in my house ( with an 11b card ) .
3521	neg	only con i can think of is no camera . . . .
2278	pos	i had a casio unit , which had given great service , and would have been happy to get another one , but was tempted by the ipod 's sleek design , storage capacity , connection options- - firewire and usb , and its integration with itunes .
1675	pos	it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design .
2830	neg	fm receiver - it has none .
2755	neg	size - bigger than the ipod
769	pos	i have n 't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .

1735	pos	i love all of the features , and presets as well .
2081	pos	overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
3149	neg	essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless .
2938	neg	3 ) folders can not be created for the audio files .
3364	neg	the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
1947	pos	photos are pretty darned good ! .
3706	neg	if you experience problems with installation , you can visit symantec 's website , click the support tab , click the 'home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it .
224	pos	when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n 't moving , the photos were awesome .
397	pos	as it turns out , this is an awesome camera ! .
2232	pos	it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
2758	neg	first , the cons . . . a tad bulky . . . not the most aesthetic looking player . . . and does n 't support a folder structure .
2443	neg	the dvd player does not work properly .
1944	pos	if i had to do it over , i wouldn 't buy anything else .
3218	neg	cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality .
1592	pos	the supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre ipod buds .
1848	pos	believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
187	pos	newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
1721	pos	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; .
2465	neg	the other thing i do n 't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .
161	pos	i wo n 't go into the details here , as the online sites ( steve 's digicams , previews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .

2008	pos	the fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool .
727	pos	- equipment included is average , but that is n 't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
3504	neg	i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( laos angele 's ) is horrendous .
1258	pos	it was a very quick setup and installation , in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up .
3382	neg	as a computer , or pda its weak since the screen , while large by phone standards , is still tiny to really do anything on .
2883	neg	i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
2312	pos	the included earphones are pretty good - my advice ? .
142	pos	works great ! .
3337	neg	this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files - just subscription wma files .
962	pos	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
1826	pos	10 great price for all the features .
411	pos	i also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it 's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot .
2949	neg	also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n 't always accurate .
1286	pos	i have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it .

1843	pos	using supplied s/w , you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it .
3429	neg	speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifices the battery life .
3074	neg	it ain 't cutting edge ( no pun intended ) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain 't pretty .
3596	neg	if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged , they charge you roughly $ 105 . 50 per minute and blame you for `` abusing `` your ipod .
3455	neg	i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time .
1759	pos	just point and shoot and the photos were great .

605	pos	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc .

2328	pos	overall , this product is awesome .
2338	pos	i have transferred in about 2 , 400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the ipod and itunes .
3084	neg	the only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust .
445	pos	it has given me zero problems , and the more i use it , the better i become at taking advantage of its strengths .
3604	neg	my only complaint ( really more of an observation ) is that the outside finish of the ipod is rather delicate , so i am going to get a case for mine so it doesn 't get all scratched up .

2611	neg	sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan 't up to the task .

1632	pos	creative has excellent music software , a very responsive tech support group ( they are quick on firmware updates , and make them publicly available ) , and usually a good array of accessories .
2627	neg	unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
2560	neg	the player kept displaying `` no disc `` , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * ! .
1991	pos	7 . have a good chunk of my small mp3 to listen through the speaker phone .
3529	neg	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .

1661	pos	but it ; . you won 't regret it .
3071	neg	however , it is much bigger , bulkier , and heavier than my other router and i would not like to use it freehand ( i keep it mounted in a table ) .
2662	neg	battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times . . . the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it 's normal .
1786	pos	the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
557	pos	the software is great .
1927	pos	the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line .

3491	neg	the gprs web access is slow ! .
3417	neg	you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu .
680	pos	despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc . .
506	pos	the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot .
325	pos	canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
144	pos	it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )
2963	neg	first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
3605	neg	if there were any complaints i have , they are marginal , but one is apples ' proprietary set-up for music files , their incompatibility with other music services ( i . e . napster ) is down right wrong .
3675	neg	the customer support is pathetic .
3620	neg	hard drive screws up occasionally
1005	pos	it 's easy to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! . ) .

1677	pos	the zen offered a great alternative .
2880	neg	the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .

375	pos	having the digic ii chip helps a lot .
752	pos	lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
67	pos	this thing plays everything i feed it .
1362	pos	pros . 1 . speed 2 . signal strength 3 . advanced configuration options
1316	pos	while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys .
937	pos	accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
3422	neg	the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy .
2870	neg	the dynamic playlists ( `` now playing `` , i be live creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate . . .
2663	neg	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera .
2341	pos	the arm band is fantastic and it doesn 't budge even at the gym .
1437	pos	the back of the player is nice too , with water ripples inside the clear white coating .
2718	neg	other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better .
1723	pos	otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; . shutter delay is n 't so bad either .
933	pos	and also , it 's priced very afford ably .
1521	pos	the interface , while a bit confusing at first , is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes .
2923	neg	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
1368	pos	however since this router is backward compatible , that doesn 't pose a problem at all .
2820	neg	another irrigation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
3140	neg	* i 'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable .
849	pos	they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
782	pos	it is an extremely cool cozmo .
723	pos	the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .

1668	pos	t simply the best player on the market for a really low price , so why look anywhere else ? .
2726	neg	sometimes the pictures are on the dark side , but i 'm able to fix that using the photoshop 6 . 0 `` adjust levels `` function . . . not sure how a person would do that without photoshop , though .
1427	pos	i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good .
3423	neg	at first glance , i thought this phone was a little too big for me , maybe a little too complicated .
1326	pos	my experience with installation was quite good .
2517	neg	this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .
3326	neg	but , all of this means nothing , because of the serious , serious , stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw : after 3 months , give or take a few weeks , you won 't be able to hear anything .
2921	neg	- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n 't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
2376	pos	mine installed no problem ( but i did uninstall my norton anti-virus 2002 & personal firewall 2002 first ) .
348	pos	i have been very impressed with my purchase of the sd500 i bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it .
1475	pos	what impressed me most was the sound .

2950	neg	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
2693	neg	1 ) it is perhaps too small .
3319	neg	i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played .
1589	pos	overall , i am very pleased with it .
1763	pos	this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .

2533	neg	the remote is a little hard to understand .
1915	pos	very cool features . . . great camera with zoom . . . cool quality pictures . . . great ringtones . . . bluetooth feature is great . . . .
3741	neg	i am giving a zero star to symantec for this version ! .
2896	neg	-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
459	pos	i am very pleased with my purchase .
1984	pos	i got a 1gb mmc upgrade for this phone and now i can :
564	pos	much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n 't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
2037	pos	2 ) nice features , like web browser , camera , video recorder , speaker phone ( very usefully ) , clear voice reception .
1377	pos	i downloaded and updated the firmware , and followed the easy setup instructions .
740	pos	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; . a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibels , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
1747	pos	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
595	pos	other than that this thing is great . . .
2048	pos	incredible memory ! .
3263	neg	apple still does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini .
20	pos	i liked this one enough to buy another .
2750	neg	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
174	pos	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
3654	neg	the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions .
931	pos	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
1695	pos	further , the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod .
3321	neg	it 's too bad , though , that ! .
3055	neg	also , diapers tend to stay in the middle , causing the pail to get backed up .
3525	neg	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
3132	neg	it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router ( mine does ) , without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired pc or a wireless equipped pc .
1487	pos	they 're easy to use .
2367	pos	we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only ( no firewall or utilities ) and so far it 's great .
1233	pos	i 've got a buddy who 's trying to offload his almost new $ 300 systematic because he saw what this router can do .
3755	neg	it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch ( greer ! . )
3229	neg	- the outlook syn ch only works for non recurring appointments , which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people . -
1920	pos	i never had a single problem .
1780	pos	the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
732	pos	so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
3612	neg	the biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin 's player was relatively new , it was riddled with scratches .
2371	pos	i 've been using nis 2004 for about 2 months and it works well .
1084	pos	i love the diaper champ , it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn 't cost an arm and a leg for refills .
2241	pos	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
3048	neg	also , for those that complain that the diaper champ isn 't as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind : as babies get older , their diets changes ( aka solid foods ! . ) and so does the smell of their diapers ! .
3216	neg	problems with the sound quality were evident right away , but even i couldn 't imagine they 'd be that bad .
2584	neg	i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n 't do it ! .
2410	neg	customer service and technical support are overloaded and non responsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .
2363	pos	i just got an older 866 mhz system with 512 pc 133 ram and it also runs fine on that .
784	pos	well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
3020	neg	the diaper genie needs it 's own refill bags in order to work and that 's just more money that you don 't have to spend .
2549	neg	after multiple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .
3313	neg	i would give it about 6 or 7 hours , although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles .
1489	pos	the earbud headphones are really nice .
1204	pos	the setup works awesome , as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it 's merits , and not just the company as a whole .
1352	pos	if you want to work wirelessly , this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now .
865	pos	i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra . . . and i was not disappointed .
658	pos	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
2332	pos	has a great helpline .
160	pos	in a word , `` awesome `` is how i would describe this camera .
1810	pos	but this camera is great ! .
2382	pos	it 's a highly rated , kick ass firewall program that 's bundled with the venerable norton antivirus , plus extras ( like norton antispam & norton parental control ) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access .
54	pos	i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .
2034	pos	other than that , the simian series 60 os is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you 're willing to hunt for it .
3692	neg	norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer .
2377	pos	seems to work great .
2413	neg	i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .
3056	neg	diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don 't tightly wrap them first .
943	pos	price ! .
2451	neg	i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone .
3586	neg	no memory stick slots -- although a rare feature , it would be nice to have extra storage , not that it needs it built-in lithium battery -- a huge hassle to bring this back ; . draining the battery once you get it helps , but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
2355	pos	perhaps semantic could work out the efficiency a little , but these reviews are highly exaggerated . . . i would ask what else these people are running on their computers ( ? . )
488	pos	other than that , i love this camera .
1391	pos	the base was deeper and the highs were crisper .
973	pos	i don 't know if we 'll run into trouble down the road with odors , but so far i have no complaints and i 'm very happy not to have to buy those refills .
3419	neg	the number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area , the fonts are small , the interface is too convoluted and frustrating , it 's not that customizable as well .
4	pos	this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .
3045	neg	all in all , the diaper champ serves its purpose , but it does not live up to its good reviews .
2599	neg	* lens visible in optical viewfinder .
3646	neg	the biggest problem is the installation .
1738	pos	touch ups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
3173	neg	both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best .
2066	pos	the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
1953	pos	great reception , visibility and interface ( may be complicated by others ) .
1088	pos	i wanted this product because i didn 't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended .
1539	pos	moving on to sound department . . . it delivers ! .
2629	neg	2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
2702	neg	i then realized a major design flaw .
850	pos	i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
1679	pos	the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 ! .
2190	pos	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
273	pos	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
721	pos	- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n 't .
533	pos	7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal .
404	pos	am so glad i bought this camera .
874	pos	the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
1506	pos	sound : this is where i love zen the most .
1637	pos	i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store 's sound system .
1043	pos	you do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the champ .
3412	neg	this simple nuance was too much for nokia , and they still refuse to acknowledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free .
3383	neg	when you dial a number , you 'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct .
1208	pos	its well made and user friendly .
1996	pos	very simple and painless .
3396	neg	the only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming .
2752	neg	transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1 . 1 or 2 . 0 .
409	pos	this is overall the best point and shoot camera i 've used .
2906	neg	creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
2909	neg	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; . only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) .
3425	neg	this phone doesn 't include phone card calling .
163	pos	i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
361	pos	when you learn how to change some settings , you can make the quality even better
2342	pos	i love the slim design ; . the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky .
1389	pos	the wrt54g plus the hga7t is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case .
1563	pos	its just as fast as the included creative software , but much less invasive , and overall better looking .
2452	neg	who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will .
1977	pos	the nokia 6600 is a great phone , good games , good camera .
2006	pos	which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in midi format for free on the net .
3479	neg	4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging .
284	pos	first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
2473	neg	now i know why - they are pieces of junk .
61	pos	seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .
2772	neg	- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
3684	neg	im at full capacity ! . ! . ! . ! . i called syman tic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at $ 35/hr to help ! . ! . i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up ! .

29	pos	nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have .
3457	neg	the video recorders a bit odd , sometimes i get 9 secs on my recordings , sometimes i get 17 .
3103	neg	this router was a huge disappointment .
1990	pos	6 . play game boy color games on it with go boy .
1531	pos	as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based player , the songs load extremely fast . . . about one or two seconds per song .
1926	pos	multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide mms messages and a gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone .
829	pos	i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; . this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57 , 000 mb of free memory available to me .
2244	pos	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
707	pos	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
1159	pos	smooth plunging ! . ( it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w/ lubricant .
2596	neg	however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my dix rips .
855	pos	now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! .
1097	pos	a wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose ! . ! . ! .
535	pos	i was looking for something that wasn 't too complicated to use and to help the pics i post on ebay show more detail .
3635	neg	as a loyal customer of norton/symantec products , i purchased internet security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product ( and hence the one star rating ) .
1778	pos	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
288	pos	also , the display is `` hinged `` and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
2956	neg	always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
3541	neg	the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .

3385	neg	i hope you have a magnifying glass , because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny .
1171	pos	for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result .
3380	neg	i 've had nokia 's for years , and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone .
1872	pos	i like it 's shape and it 's keypad and joystick .
2954	neg	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptable period of time for something to work .
899	pos	fact is , it could n 't be easier to use .
3256	neg	weak points : - touch pad : design could be better - volume control : controlled through the vertical strip , but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick .

2163	pos	i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
3094	neg	i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments , but i seldom use it .

50	pos	this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
301	pos	this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
3501	neg	the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; . you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! . ) .
1858	pos	5 . the camera installed on this phone is awesome .
912	pos	our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
2632	neg	you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
3524	neg	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
1001	pos	if you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained , than the diaper champ is the one for you ! .
795	pos	also , you can store data on it , which is a plus . for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n 't bother , this is a much better buy .
3492	neg	you can 't do that with a sony t610 ( which i traded for a 6600 ) .
957	pos	interface - practically seamless .
2391	pos	all in all it hasn 't been a bad product .
2991	neg	yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
2215	pos	i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
1322	pos	compatibility with other devices is excellent too ; . i 've only found one 11b device that won 't work with its mixed mode ( and it won 't work with *anyone 's* mixed mode ) .
1499	pos	you can use the player to store your computer data files ( good feature to have ) .
1187	pos	the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to .
431	pos	i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason .
1939	pos	everything , so far , has worked flawlessly .
2199	pos	i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
2307	pos	for a sleeker , smaller and more `` average `` mp3 player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful .
3172	neg	so-so 1 . customer service - 6 calls half were efficient other half were equally incompetent .
2388	pos	i work on word , explorer , netscape , acrobat reader , photoshop at same time ( meaning using a lot of memory ) , but still dont see a problem with computer ( getting slow or crashing ) .
1266	pos	once you set it up , it 's great .
516	pos	the metal housing seems very rugged .
2020	pos	i like the size and shape .
636	pos	not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
2626	neg	it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
2641	neg	flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get over illuminated main subjects with depth being lost .
817	pos	it comes with a good case that fits it snugly .
2159	pos	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i . e . free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jame you can even make your own apps / games .
3343	neg	. this camera keeps on outfoxing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
2283	pos	as for itunes , i don 't find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player , but it is good enough .
3060	neg	i had never liked the idea of the diaper genie because of the refills .
2874	neg	other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
608	pos	the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
958	pos	yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
332	pos	we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd500 .
1392	pos	what a kick butt mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source , instead of paying for them two or three times , then get the creative zen ipod killer , kiss my ass itunes ! .
934	pos	with 40gb of storage i have about 7 , 500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 , 500 more .
675	pos	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
1443	pos	i was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories ( desk stand/hard case , belt clip , wall charger , etc ) .
2300	pos	the sound quality is excellent , accessing the music is easy , and the controls are generally well thought out .
873	pos	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
468	pos	it fits in your pocket .
481	pos	i purchased the elph s100 mainly because i thought it was cool .
2115	pos	the reception and sound quality are top-notch .
1433	pos	the battery is removable .
1807	pos	the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
1798	pos	picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
2206	pos	i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .
793	pos	sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
1932	pos	give each friend a different ringtone .
76	pos	this player seems to work fine with everything else .
282	pos	best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
2139	pos	it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .
149	pos	i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
1812	pos	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n 't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
1445	pos	it 's being used daily and i have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers ( headphone jack , player locking up , etc ) .
1450	pos	the screen is clear and readable , and the touch pad works very well , it took me less than a day to get the hang of it , and now i like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control .
1422	pos	i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright .
1307	pos	drops and strong signals even from the backyard .
1241	pos	cuts are easy and smooth .
1978	pos	the voice recorders good , but you can 't record songs off the radio for ring tones .
527	pos	2- excellent picture quality and so simple to use ! . ! . ! .
1854	pos	the phone is sturdy .
2414	neg	this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n 't purchase it .
2221	pos	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
2638	neg	the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
446	pos	this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer ( with photo quality paper ) .
2635	neg	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
876	pos	3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
807	pos	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
1623	pos	however after playing with it for three weeks now , i 'm convinced , the zen micro is superior .
3506	neg	since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work `` in 24 hours `` .
1197	pos	even with that , i highly recommend this router - outstanding performer .
3533	neg	the vibrate setting is loud ! .
3012	neg	the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .
887	pos	9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
406	pos	the view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer .
145	pos	either way , can 't go wrong with this price .
1466	pos	creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices .
1808	pos	there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera ! .
1657	pos	gets nice sound too .
1601	pos	best in class .
3574	neg	there is also no voice recording , something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn 't .
854	pos	given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
3249	neg	the touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well , and as i never had issues getting songs transferred to the player , i did have problems accessing them from the player .
1495	pos	if anyone is thinking of getting an ipod mini , forget it and go with this player .
545	pos	this camera is so easy to use ! .
2415	neg	apex does n 't answer the phone .
170	pos	1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n 't want to bother with the settings .
1516	pos	while i have not had the `` privilege `` , as many call it , of owning an ipod , based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod ( and subsequently purchased the zen touch or zen micro ) , i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the zen micro was one of the more informed ones .
2026	pos	their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific .
1390	pos	all of this said [ as it 's on it 's way back to amazon ] , the one song it did include provided far better sound than the ipod .
210	pos	but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in `` auto `` mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! .
2534	neg	my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 `` screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 `` monitor .
3508	neg	apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
3723	neg	sure they say if it 's their fault you won 't get charged , but they are the ones who get to decide whether it 's their fault .
2605	neg	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
841	pos	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
3068	neg	the adjustment knob seemed ok , but when lowering the router , i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob .
3761	neg	start up , log off , log on . . . everything became very slow .
1804	pos	after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocally that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
2488	neg	i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n 't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .
652	pos	the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
2164	pos	the features are really cool like the radio .
2962	neg	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
1052	pos	this holds alot and does not take up alot of space .
1493	pos	it 's faster than wmp .
3345	neg	. images taken indoor were n 't so clear .
1596	pos	it 's still alive , still kicking , and still playing .
3462	neg	the only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky .
2684	neg	another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function .
1728	pos	the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
1486	pos	i love the touchpaper controls .
2499	neg	my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .
3734	neg	no problems now , just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned their customers .
2818	neg	software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
3390	neg	only thing i don 't like about it is slow in changing apps , boot up , and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth .
1556	pos	it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black .
2114	pos	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
3284	neg	the machine itself seems fine , but the software that came with it is awful .
2799	neg	3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
519	pos	the panorama modes are wonderful .
254	pos	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! . )
1405	pos	upon opening the box i was confronted with this small cute little mp3 player .
2892	neg	* software is absolutely terrible :
2113	pos	nice little phone . . . light compact . .
1757	pos	this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon . never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
3330	neg	the flaw is inside the zen .
3668	neg	the program brings more problems than a virus , albeit not as major problems , just not what you expect for 70 bucks .
2207	pos	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
3611	neg	looks and durability : i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface .
2947	neg	headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
3667	neg	there are some highs to the 2004 edition , but mostly lows .
3583	neg	one caveat i have is that i understand the ipod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved .
2152	pos	nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
3115	neg	the fine adjustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table .
2861	neg	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n 't have them .
2907	neg	3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
3252	neg	if someone asked me flat out , i 'd say to go woth something else .
904	pos	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! .
880	pos	6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
505	pos	i just went on a quick photo shoot in nyc 's central park today , and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took , if i do say so myself ( and i do ! . )
8	pos	and amazon . com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? .
168	pos	i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
3650	neg	back in may 2004 , when i first reviewed this , it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run .
1523	pos	transferring files couldn 't be easier thanks to the included software bundle .
1560	pos	i 'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its li-ion battery , the better firmware , or a combination of both factors .
1892	pos	the 6600 has more amenities than most - world phone , camera ( vga/zoom/night mode/timer ) , video ( w/ audio & zoom ) , speaker ( good sound ) , bluetooth , infrared , modem for computers , electronic wallet , internet access , calendar , calculator , converter and more .
78	pos	apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .
1135	pos	hitachi 's m12v is a big beast of a router .
2987	neg	the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
2041	pos	if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with isync , i say stick with a sonyericsson .
2016	pos	have had the nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with t-mobile .
3169	neg	the instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually .
1139	pos	this is truly a clydesdale among the industry 3hp+ router workhorses .
2530	neg	apex sucks ! .
1284	pos	overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s/w worked well to connect .
2471	neg	i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disappointed ! .
3473	neg	there is no way you can talk with customer care about this .
17	pos	i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
2839	neg	it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
2972	neg	at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .
663	pos	finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
1189	pos	i 've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it .
2931	neg	to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
1221	pos	the height adjustment works well- not perfect .
3217	neg	the eq is awful , and even at top volumes , the bass is flat sounding .
2250	pos	the bass is deep and the treble is clear .
1844	pos	goes ~3 days after a charge .
2586	neg	unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds . even though they were not damaged in any way .
430	pos	and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s30 .
497	pos	i give this product five stars for its usability , performance , expandability , and definitely looks ! .
2087	pos	this phone is a winner . . .
2266	pos	it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall , which i hear is a step up from the other ipods , which require you plug it into a computer to charge it .
278	pos	it is very simple to import via photo 2 and then move them to photoshop .
1522	pos	battery life is exceptional , lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market .
1899	pos	secondly , all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of usb wires .
2993	neg	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n 't notice after first day .
1231	pos	i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi ( my only hitachi tool , by the way ) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder .
3468	neg	they really are awfully small .
3219	neg	the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use , and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony 's i 'd been having .
3356	neg	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
900	pos	sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
540	pos	this is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory , for example .
1090	pos	the champ works great .
1414	pos	it feels tiny in the hand without it .
123	pos	this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
2853	neg	the quick sync is n 't any good because it either needs to be configured properly or just is n 't very useful .
2438	neg	some movies it played yesterday , it wo n 't play today .
328	pos	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
313	pos	the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
2514	neg	now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .
715	pos	naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recommend www . no madness . net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
1444	pos	and so far , i have been very , very happy with my zen micro .
2321	pos	you can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it .
1749	pos	really happy with this little camera .
1933	pos	get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings .
2192	pos	even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
2748	neg	one beef is the scroll , it does n 't work as well as i 'd like .
21	pos	my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .
2194	pos	overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
1086	pos	the height is a more convenient reach than others , where you have to hunch over .
546	pos	all the features are incredibly intuitive , even for a novice like me .
2933	neg	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
2783	neg	this is ridiculous .
1055	pos	at first i had a problem with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all ! .
3580	neg	the back of the ipod is in a chrome finish , and this surface is prone to scratches .
770	pos	all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
1710	pos	the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
1737	pos	the software you get with this camera is perfect .
3602	neg	apple closed their island to anything that resembled microsoft , and clearly let napster know it could not use their products with napster 's services .
2225	pos	great screen and great sound .
3555	neg	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
3714	neg	after telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program ( which i had already done ) . . .
2836	neg	otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
681	pos	this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
3705	neg	i give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user .
2147	pos	color screen is good .
781	pos	the software could n 't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n 't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
1281	pos	you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network .
901	pos	even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
223	pos	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
1264	pos	i recently bought the linksys wrt54g router and have been very happy with the router itself .
1110	pos	we just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are scented and they are like $ 6 . 00 and they work great .
2669	neg	the only problem i have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don 't have a nice click .
391	pos	the photo quality is amazing .
3731	neg	they said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $ 15 to `` handle `` and ship a cd ? . -- and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails .
2107	pos	overall , i highly recommend this phone .
2521	neg	one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .
2539	neg	but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .
30	pos	we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .
206	pos	the more i work with it , the more i love it ! .
2275	pos	. itunes -- this is a love-hate relationship program ; . usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc , but depending on your computer expertise , this could be a difficult program to use , and it is required for an ipod .
28	pos	while i would like to give it 3 . 5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .
3515	neg	they are not wow able good .
2449	neg	unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n 't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .
3099	neg	i no longer use it as a plunge router , only as a stationary or table mounted router .
3742	neg	the only way my pc internet works is if i open the firewall program configuration and manually refresh it .
2035	pos	initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone , web browser and of course the built in camera .
2657	neg	after 57 pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings .
3023	neg	the hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as i am now using medium diapers ( i have a 3 month old ) and they 're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact i make then and how un-soiled they are .
514	pos	even with the waterproof housing it is small .
566	pos	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
1344	pos	the in ital setup of the router was simple .
135	pos	the build quality feels solid , it does n 't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dots and dd5 . 1 sound good ) .
2776	neg	i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
47	pos	but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n 't anticipate any problems with it .
1628	pos	an extra gig of room , fm radio , voice recorder , pim applications with sync to outlook .
343	pos	the canon is very small , definitely pocket size , but still easy to hold firmly .
1533	pos	after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md-e828lp 's and sennheiser mx-400 's , i find myself still using the creative 's , which in my opinion , sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord .
1341	pos	i was an early purchaser of the wrt54g , and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally , the march 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product ! .
1822	pos	6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
1367	pos	reset the network , tried the connection , and it 's working like a charm .
731	pos	i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
2566	neg	apex 's website is down and they wo n 't answer their phone .
3061	neg	gets stinky after a few months , the seal on the piston doesn 't seal anymore .
1765	pos	i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
1941	pos	i think the interface is great .
2431	neg	i also did n 't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .
376	pos	this camera takes amazing pictures and its size can not be beat .
3599	neg	its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily , not great from a cosmetic standpoint .
2054	pos	i love this phone .
1647	pos	actually , the creative zen micro solves all that .
2462	neg	as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .
3002	neg	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
2603	neg	2 ) not very ergonomically - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
2966	neg	the general button placement is not very user friendly .
68	pos	when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n 't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
1972	pos	as i drove across the country i lost reception only in eastern kentucky 's mountains .
2306	pos	however after purchasing a 20 gb ipod it 's clear to see the superiority .
428	pos	i have a canon a 70 , and now this sd500 , its amazing , how this little camera produces , such great pics , it even brings out ur pimples on the face .
2365	pos	you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks .
2781	neg	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
2324	pos	the ipod package comes with everything you need , the ac adaptor , firewire cable ( quicker than usb , but slower than usb 2 which it also gives ) , those snazzy and power full headphones , and of course the player .
743	pos	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .

1257	pos	this router does everything that it is supposed to do , so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it .

2930	neg	in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .

558	pos	transfering is easy , the software makes everything pretty easy .
951	pos	the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
1781	pos	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .

1202	pos	they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered .
3073	neg	if you think you are saving $ 40 getting the hitachi , you are right , and you are also getting a router worth $ 40 less than a makita .

2052	pos	n6600 supports midi , wav , arm , mp3 etc .
2354	pos	sure , it slows it down a little , but that 's expected .
1925	pos	i use a nokia 6600 , it has a great color tft display and camera equipped with zoom , which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a real one player for playback and streaming of 3gpp-compatible and real media video clips .
2580	neg	all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing creepiness of this very embarassing gift .
1138	pos	nice things about the m12v : - in a table , the powerful 3 1/4 hp motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - amazon 's price
1945	pos	upside : this one , like most nokias , receives a consistently strong signal ( i 've tried some samsung and sony ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front ) .
3433	neg	3- it is slow , if you keep the original configuration and prigs ( why 'd u buy it then ? . ! . ) it 'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen nokias .

119	pos	still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features ! .
676	pos	transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2 . 0 .
3748	neg	it feels like i 'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service , even though i 'm running a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year .
2280	pos	the ipod is a very nice product , which given reasonable care , should give a lot of service .

3193	neg	i took my zen micro with me over the weekend , and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason : to keep the zen micro charged .
2137	pos	and really this is the best phone one could have .
99	pos	amazon is awesome ! .
1054	pos	it holds almost a week 's worth of diapers , and you don 't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work .

3379	neg	you can upgrade but then there 's a certain level of trouble involved .
2917	neg	- the software that came with it was tough to load .
1479	pos	the zen was an impressive purchase and i would highly recommend it to anyone using napster .
2434	neg	it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .
2756	neg	software - music match jukebox is n 't the greatest , the search function is n 't fast even when accessing it with the hot key shortcut .
230	pos	contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
131	pos	good quality video .
1527	pos	the extra gb of hard rive space , remove able battery and fm tuner , as well as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me .

462	pos	it 's overkill for simple snapshots , unless you 've got way too much money to blow .
3764	neg	while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with `` alerts `` every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off .
2505	neg	i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
1260	pos	it works great , i am usually at the full 54 mbps , although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is .
2588	neg	the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n 't see on a sony and an overall plastic feel
358	pos	you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on . . . literally ! .
1470	pos	i was more excited about this player upon opening than i was about the nomad .
1372	pos	there is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features .
241	pos	by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stop action photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
357	pos	start up is so quick
2867	neg	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature . . . but not on this player . . .
2494	neg	i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .
1888	pos	i feel much less likely to drop this phone than others , which are actually starting to get too small .
3750	neg	there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec/norton site .
2012	pos	especially for the price amazon gives it at ( i was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications ) .
2914	neg	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
2357	pos	the antivirus feature is phenomenal , and is regularly updated .
2198	pos	great features . . .
3273	neg	es , the interface took a little getting used to , but once i did , it 's almost second nature now .

1244	pos	i really liked the price . . .

802	pos	first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
538	pos	the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use .
1912	pos	the plusses are the features , look , good signal and battery life , memory size and robustness .
3394	neg	but not good enough for me .
1248	pos	the power , low noise operation , and speed control makes up for the problems i have experienced .
542	pos	after getting one for christmas from amazon , i 'm now a believer : the digital elph is truly the world 's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures .
3626	neg	i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful .
3464	neg	however , it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn 't work at all in the car , for example .
414	pos	when the overall image quality ( especially natural colours , details , natural looking of the pictures ) is the most important thing , then this camera its top notch and very impressive .
725	pos	- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
1922	pos	high quality video and pictures rock ! .
3054	neg	cons - difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as i was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor .
74	pos	unlike some of the other people who received a `` lemon `` , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
1885	pos	if you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday , nokia beats everyone else .
2007	pos	you can use the ob ex file transfer service with bluetooth from linux ( kde-bluetooth provides a nice integration into conqueror for this ) for sending files to the phone .
2710	neg	i originally gave this camera 5 stars . when i had windows 98 it was wonderful but i got a new computer last november with xp the usb software is soho . . . not compatible with xp
1934	pos	a huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it .
1454	pos	with the right firmware , drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive .
2498	neg	it would just spin up and stop , and display `` no disc `` .
1626	pos	mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download .
3191	neg	) worst feature possible , this alone makes it rate one star : what 's up with no recharge cord ? .
1102	pos	also , it takes any kitchen sized trash bag , so there is no special bag to stock .
2791	neg	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
2774	neg	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
3268	neg	another thing i don 't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up .
2470	neg	it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .
213	pos	i highly recommend it .
661	pos	the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .

3044	neg	the product also leaves a faint smell in the room .
1971	pos	outside of the t-mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at & t wireless and various other services where the t-mobile service was unavailable .
3436	neg	i 'm an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
507	pos	the two-times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly , and lo and behold , a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off .
1021	pos	*holds the odor in nicely ! .
3332	neg	the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer , not an ipod killer .
2644	neg	to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; . however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
3307	neg	imagine my disappointment , though , when the zen micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest fm signals in my area .
3091	neg	if it weren 't so big i would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers . .
749	pos	i am very pleased so far .
3645	neg	they are a royal pain to install , and don 't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all .
2486	neg	the first one would n 't work from the start .
120	pos	this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .
3255	neg	it 's perfect for those who aren 't planning on storing tons of music .
638	pos	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
2850	neg	as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
2814	neg	e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
764	pos	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
138	pos	i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n 't had any problems .
3043	neg	for one thing , the diapers always get jammed in it .
1047	pos	let the champ win you over ! .
2500	neg	you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .
788	pos	it 's easy .

2692	neg	it 's not my first choice in cameras ,
1234	pos	it is without even a slight doubt , my new favorite .
1106	pos	this one is really great .
1463	pos	it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside .
1930	pos	i 'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does , but for me the best thing is that i can easily check my email , movie times , news , or any website with this phone .
1101	pos	it works easily with one hand , which is important .
902	pos	the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
2904	neg	mediasource did not recognize my tags ! .
2640	neg	the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
3338	neg	the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10 % or so .
2044	pos	putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download .
82	pos	i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! .
3311	neg	respectable , solid , but not awe-inspiring .
511	pos	really like it , easy to use , great images , very intuitive , fits in my jacket pocket .
2769	neg	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n 't figure out a way to break it .
741	pos	the software has n 't been a hassle for me at all .
405	pos	all the good reviews for the sd500 are true .
72	pos	excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jv players .
1942	pos	i actually purchased two phones recently ( this one at the new blackberry phone ) , and this one is far superior ( imho ) .
2049	pos	aside from a 6mb++ built-in phone memory , there 's a 32mb mmc card that goes with it ! .
3663	neg	once again it won 't reinstall , even with online and email assistance from symantect technicians .
984	pos	1 . it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills .
808	pos	zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .

1719	pos	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
3035	neg	but be prepared to buy something else ( diaper genie ? . ) which can trap the odor better .
2881	neg	the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
1474	pos	in minutes i was easily navigating through the menus .
2246	pos	but , i would definately recommend this phone .
2848	neg	if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get `` stuck `` rapidly going through the songs and wo n 't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
3373	neg	mine generally requires a charge every 48 hours or so and i don 't really talk on it that much .
1482	pos	it looks sleek and modern .

591	pos	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
3643	neg	for purposes of clarity , here is my review from that product , edited to be appropriate for this product , since , for the most part , they share many of the same problems .
134	pos	this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .
3287	neg	of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at creative , through their website , and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless .
3117	neg	i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the `` sliding wrench `` which comes on the router .

825	pos	* price and capacity

3632	neg	being a past norton customer , i consider this to be a slap to my face .
318	pos	the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
334	pos	a digic ii-powered image-processing system enables the sd500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip , its start-up time is tops in its class , and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition .

400	pos	bottom line , this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck ! .
1696	pos	i have had several mp3 players over the past few years , and have to say that this by far is the best that i 've owned .
2751	neg	also , the instruction manual is very bad .
3250	neg	many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all > i would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well .
3770	neg	i simply hate symantec . i swear , if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare , bleeding hands , i would have .
3125	neg	luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case , a finger .

868	pos	many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .

55	pos	i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
3318	neg	so i took out the battery and put it back in again , only to find that it would not work .
2009	pos	i really dislike holding a phone to my ear , and i 've found the free speak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone .

1476	pos	at 128 the songs sound very good .
2302	pos	the battery holds a charge for a very long time ( maybe 15 or so hours of use ) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use .
286	pos	however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
112	pos	of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .
475	pos	i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon .
2778	neg	had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .
2343	pos	the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing .
2997	neg	do n 't buy this player .
3198	neg	iriver has a better fm receiver built in , but the drawback to iriver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed .

1296	pos	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wireless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth .
3276	neg	yes , there is a belt clip , but that doesn 't hold the extra battery and usb cable .
2001	pos	if you are using linux , and you want to use gprs to connect to the net , i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter .
2165	pos	the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
175	pos	5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
499	pos	the software has been installed on windows 95 , 98 , 2000 and xp and i haven 't had any problems with it .
1606	pos	it also has tons more features then previous creative products , and most of them are very useful such as the ability to customize the main menu to show the stuff you want , not the default items ( creative labs . com for more on that ) .
1022	pos	( every now and then i spray down the inside of the pail with lysol ) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail , but that is rare -- and it usually just means that we 've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag .
2399	pos	pi ii 1ghz 512mb rd ram windows xp pro 80gb hd i was able to uninstall nis 2003 and install nis 2004 with no trouble .

520	pos	it 's so small and light , even with a spare battery , you really can take it anywhere .
2053	pos	it has a handsfree loudspeaker , conference and transfer ! .
3340	neg	i don 't know , maybe i got a defective one but first , the player would not shut off , next , the player would not come on - i had to send it away to get repaired .

2466	neg	the entire unit was poorly crafted .
1126	pos	5 . the price is right .
105	pos	i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .

420	pos	the manual is excellent .
1439	pos	i have no problem using itunes with the zen micro ( in a makeshift sorta way ) .
2970	neg	i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
3560	neg	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
594	pos	when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
843	pos	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
1949	pos	with one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around , seamless bluetooth sync with microsoft outlook , support for thousands of applications for the symbian platform which this phone runs on ( i own the ir remote , iq and a few others ) , the nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from t-mobile that can claim such a distinction .
3227	neg	- the battery life leaves a lot to be desired .
1288	pos	i would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something , but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router , just get the wrt54g .
1718	pos	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
62	pos	also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and br mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
1961	pos	the speed is the same as dali up , where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up .
2809	neg	this thing is trash .
1674	pos	if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can 't go wrong with the zen micro .
342	pos	sharper pictures .
3440	neg	my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use .
3566	neg	there isn 't much features on the ipod at all , except games .
2986	neg	the one and most major thing that i was disappointed with , in this player , is the battery life .

1797	pos	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
424	pos	i am impressed with this camera inside and out .
495	pos	this is a great product , and canon has done an excellent job .

1584	pos	i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast , and they all sound great .
1219	pos	this is a well-made and powerful tool .
526	pos	i 've had a lot of cameras , but this one is actually being used , and not stored in a desk : it 's all ways in my shiest pocket .
687	pos	overall i like the unit .
2601	neg	the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n 't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
961	pos	it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
1784	pos	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down . now buy it ! .
3026	neg	but , sometimes , if the champ is too full , the flip handle won 't function .
956	pos	sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
3568	neg	durability : not good . first problem , if you haven 't seen the news recently , the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months .
1252	pos	this is a quality product , not to be confused with the cheap junk that hitachi gets manufactured in china .
1294	pos	i 've since gotten the linksys modem ( befcmu10 ) and stacked it with the wrt54g router and it works fantastic ! . ! . ! .
1873	pos	it 's easy to use . not too small , and not too big .
2404	pos	their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions .
3410	neg	though nearly a dozen different people at both t-mobile and nokia have told me otherwise , it is simply not possible to use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices .
896	pos	replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
3357	neg	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
2029	pos	the nokia 660 runs the symbian os , which works pretty well for most standard phone fare , most of the stuff is not that intuitive , but if you actually learn how to use it all , there 's plenty of neat tie-ins .
3165	neg	unfortunately , linksys does not write the best documentation .
3539	neg	- no proprietary headset jack
3033	neg	i just wished that it didn 't fill up so fast ! .
1040	pos	with the champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid .
2857	neg	my only significant complaint is sound quality .
928	pos	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of `` now playing `` interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
832	pos	the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
2973	neg	battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
285	pos	this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
233	pos	but at least you re starting with the most photo realistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
3713	neg	again , every review written about the tech line is true . . . after waiting close to 45 minutes i finally spoke to a rep .
3163	neg	i was having intermittent problems with it losing connection .
3189	neg	who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a `` foreign `` computer just to move over some simple ( * . txt ) files ? .
3041	neg	the plug er gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess .
2988	neg	you need the software to actually transfer files
3282	neg	also , the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable ( although my wife didn 't have a problem ) , so i bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones .
1034	pos	i think it 's great .
978	pos	it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go ! .
3271	neg	they obviously have quality and reliability problems .
1046	pos	regardless to this fact , i believe the champ is the best way to go .
3727	neg	their site offers no live help at all .
299	pos	the image quality is excellent .
1613	pos	+sorts music by artist , album , genre , etc . . . it 's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you 're looking for .
2392	pos	i 've owned many norton products in my time , and for the most part , i 've been pleased with their performance .
1369	pos	overall , it 'll make my move that much easier knowing i don 't have to worry about connectivity .
3659	neg	if you have an older version of `` internet security `` installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install .
2482	neg	each of the 4 lasted less than six months .
919	pos	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
2418	neg	they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .
3691	neg	we constantly got `` windows virtual memory low `` error messages popping up foll wed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes .
3381	neg	on the plus side it 's packed with features , including bluetooth that works fine - it 's really a tiny computer that is also a phone . . . and that 's the negative .
2887	neg	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
2218	pos	it has a classic design yet looks hip .
3300	neg	i tried to use the fm radio option , but it doesn 't seem to really pick up the stations i listen , however i am going to try it in a different location , it may have just been my residential location .
2712	neg	the adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application .
586	pos	the other controls are all very easy to use .
1567	pos	its ability to record radio is useful as well , but would have been more so if it could be preset .
317	pos	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
2804	neg	in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
3188	neg	this one is particularly bothersome : allegedly one can use the zen micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another .
399	pos	the sd500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed .
2295	pos	finally , compare the ipod to other players on a cost/gb , and also consider ease of use .
1401	pos	creative media source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it , and the file transfers are fast .
2541	neg	p . s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ? .
3222	neg	i got about 700 loaded up before it told me i was full , and at that point , i was ready to toss it out the window .
1423	pos	best of all the wmas ( i have a lot of them ) sound great .
3157	neg	the installation software cd crashed repeatedly .
1207	pos	the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good masada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results .
3152	neg	after some research on the net , i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt54g design ( wrt54g , version 3 , which amazon currently sells ) .
251	pos	8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
1569	pos	so far it has been very durable ( other than the little pads on the earbuds ) , but those aren 't really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own .
3000	neg	do not buy this product --
111	pos	the dvd player is fine .
65	pos	i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch wide screen dvd 's to normal .
422	pos	very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures .
1174	pos	on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable , it is just a plunge router that works really well .
220	pos	i love this camera .
2589	neg	remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .
619	pos	i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
1988	pos	4 . play n-gage games on it .
3328	neg	again , the headphone jack on this thing is garbage .
3199	neg	as i wrote , this could have been a great product , but expect hidden charges ( read gross profiteering and price gouging ) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage .
1805	pos	its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
3308	neg	it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound .
2659	neg	the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures , especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can .
826	pos	* slick-looking design and improved interface
2323	pos	for looks , well ipod is head and shoulders better , both the iriver and creative zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming ipod .
513	pos	i wanted standard memory expansion ( cf cards ) , macro mode , and if possible , a waterproof housing ( for kayaking ) .
1228	pos	the ones i 've kept ( porter cables , dew alts , bosch , and this hitachi ) have proven their worth over the years , however , when i need a real workhorse , i grab this router .
2555	neg	the ad-1600 did n 't work correctly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .
3503	neg	i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
2150	pos	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
369	pos	it 's such a great camera ! . i think it really was worth the investment = )
1796	pos	autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
3603	neg	as a windows user , i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop , and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance .
3420	neg	this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people .
1430	pos	i didnt have any installation problems ; . and the touch pad is fine , even if it is sort of inaccurate .
2922	neg	- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n 't sure how long it would last .
1859	pos	i click pictures in jog format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth .
2557	neg	we tried the `` finding memo `` dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason .
3144	neg	the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection .
1402	pos	sound quality is great , fm tuner is fine , as is the recorder .
2918	neg	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
2504	neg	i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .
2450	neg	but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .
3452	neg	t-mobile wasn 't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate .
196	pos	although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
1468	pos	it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk .
472	pos	it has one more resolution of 1024x768 and a `` normal `` compression mode . and , it has the 3x zoom .
2577	neg	both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .
1136	pos	in my table the m12v has been a real champ .
3209	neg	the headphones are not very comfortable , but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have .
3030	neg	the opening could be a little wider , i suppose , but i haven 't really seen anything else that could be improved .
2826	neg	1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
2794	neg	1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
2459	neg	unit took forever since the beginning to recognize and play discs .
2394	pos	i upgraded from nis 2003 , and the change in performance has not been noticeable .
3147	neg	the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half .
235	pos	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
2099	pos	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; . the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
1655	pos	) no locked-in proprietary business like apple ; . this baby plays wmas too .
15	pos	player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
147	pos	for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
3712	neg	my file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites .
487	pos	the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots .

1188	pos	its not a perfect system but its a very good one .
1251	pos	this is a fantastic tool to use .
1500	pos	battery : a big big plus .
1965	pos	i was looking for a phone which synced with mac osx using bluetooth , had decent battery life , could check email , had good reception , nice screen size and was durable ( i break often break small gadgets )
2905	neg	2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
1056	pos	personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ .
2239	pos	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
1481	pos	it 's so small .
2393	pos	this is also the case with nis 2004 .
2061	pos	and also , since it is teri band and since it uses sim-card , you can just use it in europe and many other parts of the world , wherever gsm exists .
245	pos	1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
1323	pos	setup in xp was instant and intuitive .
828	pos	despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! .
2071	pos	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3 . 5 ) , but unfortunately , i am returning it .
1665	pos	the software is very easy to use , and the transfer is super fast ! .
2120	pos	but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street . . .
2731	neg	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
572	pos	the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! .

402	pos	very good `` every day `` camera . fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos .
1104	pos	i was using the cheaper pail . . . and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart .
3352	neg	also , the lens cap design is flawed .
2086	pos	the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone `` unlike the nokia 3650 `` and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make . . .
1140	pos	built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig .
498	pos	first , i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software .
