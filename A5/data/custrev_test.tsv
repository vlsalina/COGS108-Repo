3546	its quiet .
3232	overall , it does its basic function very well , but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occasion .
979	i love that you don 't have to purchase expensive refills .
372	i bought this camera two days ago , and i 'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money .
3278	it barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzes all over the player , because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart .
3683	now in october , 2004 , the firewall said i couldn 't ok anymore software to use the internet because its full .
742	lastly , the price is fantastic :
3471	these people takes lest effort to process rebate forms .
1509	i compared it to other cd players ( two models of panasonic , rio & samsung ) and they were no way even near zen micro .
1079	i have never had an odor problem ! .
3753	buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks .
581	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n 't blind you when you stare too long .
3589	first , let me say that i got the 20gb ipod for christmas , and i most likely would not have spent the $ 300 myself .
2563	5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .
419	neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings .
2133	the phone is very light weight .
2240	this phone is highly recommended otherwise .
1605	pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too .
895	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www . ipod 's dirty secret . com .
3101	it 's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router , activate the chuck lock , and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up .
1724	nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
1771	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
3400	even the instruction booklet is out of order .
3185	so , you might inquire , why don 't they make it a first priority to carefully , simply explain how download music from your music library to their device ? . ? . ? . this seems academic to me .
787	oh . . . and file transfers are fast & easy .
616	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
3341	now , the player 's ear phone jack is not working - i have to send it away again .
1773	it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
3096	that said , i am disappointed in the plunging mechanism .
2771	i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
3484	after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem .
812	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
2608	the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
806	third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
691	overall i like it .
2269	decent battery -- on the average size , but the 40gb comes with a dock .
2623	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
3647	also if you do manage to get it installed , any problems with liveupdate or with system works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating internet security .
1572	this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro .
2022	it also works just fine for international calls .
290	i have owned this camera for a short time and would n 't give it up for anything .
271	the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
3398	operation : it 's like bmw 's i-drive - it does it 's job , but has the most unintuitive , overly-layered interface .
1299	i upgraded from an older 801 . 11b router to the linksys wrt54g for its improved security , and of course , speed .
2945	the only thing i do n 't like about this is the cover does suck .
3516	it also does n 't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! . ! .
3358	the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
2129	one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
3766	i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago , and it wouldn 't let me do that either .
3486	if there was a zero-star rating i would give it .
3062	also , diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston .
2526	for example , i tried playing my new `` pirates of the caribbean `` extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .
3240	the karma is only $ 5 more , it 's small , had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including gog .
1800	the `` scene `` mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a `` regular `` setting .
3223	my friend has an ipod , and although the sound quality probably won 't meet most audiophile standards , the product itself is better than anything creative has made .
2106	this phone has many other features , ir , ; . just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
3194	i have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone .
38	i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
2119	it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
2697	this is due to the unusually slow autofocus system .
2154	i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
2217	the radio feature has superb sound quality .
3618	however , the battery life isn 't as good as i would like .
2200	i have had no problems with the phone .
2289	there 's even an equalizer ( under `` settings `` ) that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic , bass booster , bass reducer , classical , dance , `` deep `` , and electronic .
2780	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
632	the software was great , as long as you have an administrative user account ( windows xp ) .
2897	my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the dds service , the ripping process fails to populate the `` year `` field .
473	but it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2 . 1 mp camera .
1031	there is no comparison , the champ is easy and smell free , the genie was difficult to use one handed ( which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad ) and there was a def finite odor emanating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn 't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ .
303	this camera is closest to perfect than any other diagram that is 4-5 megapixel .
3416	it 's important that people know the following : first , the interface is slow .
2142	its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed & # 38 ; . phone lying by your pillow side .
2074	i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n 't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
1464	a distinct ipod relation is evident with white colored cables , power plug and the very nice zen case with a white rubber inside covering .
37	i find this to be a great feature .
3184	after attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system , i could not get the unit to download my wma files .
985	3 . it never smelled - at all .
1066	not only is it much more cost effective ( you can use regular trash bags rather than refills at $ 5 a pop ) , it is easier to use and clean , and has a larger capacity .
2299	the great and versatile ipod
1057	it is mindless to operate .
2453	we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work `` apex `` dvd players and none worked .
2379	while it didn 't have all the features i would have liked , it was better than anything else i could find at the time .
3657	warning ! . the windows `` remove program `` feature does not do a good job of this , and neither does norton 's own removal program .
1167	saw the hitachi on amazon . com with their $ 25 . 00 coupon ( at the time ) and could not resist trying it out .
2790	the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
3134	however , configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours , and briefly made me reconsider my choice to for ego the airport and its notoriously easy setup .
1388	apart from speed , the signal is consistent and works without interruptions , etc .
590	they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
1006	it 's also easy to empty out .
597	the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
1653	no skips , and it hasn 't faltered once ( despite your inevitable drop or two .
1478	the earbuds are great headphones as good as my ak studio 240 , well not as good but darn close .
2097	i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
2975	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
1350	this model appears to be especially good .
920	huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
59	we are overall pleased with product .
524	1- small .
831	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
783	well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
2835	software - the software is crap .
1982	the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don 't play games that much , and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat .
3671	so i e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs ) .
1964	this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard .
242	the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
3535	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2 . 5 mm headset jack .
297	canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
10	it sure does ! .
2645	this camera has a major design flaw .
1722	but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; . an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
1554	the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it ( a stand , a belt hook , charger ) that i know doesn 't come with every one .
2711	the new drivers on cannon 's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software .
2460	3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .
3150	however , this product performed well below my expectation .
805	the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
2749	deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ) .
3063	i gave up and got a diaper decor .
2405	weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; . it does n 't show the complete file names of mp3s with really long names ; . you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc . ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .
1306	the dual antenna is a plus and the design is slick .
1643	i like some local stations , stern , and npr , and so the radio seemed like a great option .
2926	i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
1884	4 ) one nice thing about nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices .
2317	overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast . the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people would ever need and , for the price , i highly recommend it .
1432	all-in-all , its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use .
702	for the price and features it is really good .
521	in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera .
2965	the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
2096	this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
2989	the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sis , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
2132	i like the automatic key lock function .
2319	finding all the albums , songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig ( well 18 gig ) worth of music .
1050	even did while daughter sleep and no noise ! .
3466	the only problem is the size of the keys .
1081	in fact , people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son 's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent ' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ .
1092	we 've never experienced odor from the pail .
1263	its the easiest thing to setup i thought , and i am only 16 . . . so with all that said , buy the router ! . ! . ! . ! .
3166	i tried to do this by instinct and it 's not intuitive unless you are a network geek .
1382	getting the router setup in a `` vanilla `` configuration that works for 99 % of users was very easy , and i was able to do this no problem .
729	this player is an ideal purchase .
1175	i use it in the table ( never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob ) , in my woo drat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances .
179	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
2461	after @ 3 months , it stopped playing higher number scenes on dvds .
2223	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
3244	the support has been less than impressive , considering the cost .
536	this camera is great , wonderfully small , and has attractive hi-tech casing .
3130	if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way ! .
755	i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
1680	other mp3 players won 't give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won 't at lower ones , either .
1168	unlike other reviewers , i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table .
3280	on the downside , i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software ! .
1703	by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money ; . if you are undecided , the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice .
2010	but if you use all bluetooth accessories , as i do , its really not an issue .
349	the pictures are tack sharp , colors are vivid , and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire .
3261	you have to wonder why creative can 't get this right .
3124	my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful .
3359	the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone else 's is too .
713	overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
2447	unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .
799	the storage capacity is great for me --
2948	the software sucks .
1317	the new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process .
883	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows media player , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cb service ( gracenotes ) .
1609	anyway , my wife got this for me for my birthday and i love the thing .
2121	- light , compact design
1541	speaking of battery , it 's removable and replaceable ! .
1183	i find it very stable and comfortable to use , it doesn 't jump around or make me feel like i need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control , and it has very good visibility to see your cut .
238	manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
3378	video recording is limited at just 9 seconds .
1218	the first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use .
2992	creative software stinks .
2613	the grain was terrible .
2768	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
3567	it has an equalizer , but the iriver h10-20gb has a lot more presets than the ipod .
2668	i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd500 are not as robust , but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the digital rebel .
2990	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
3439	downside : it takes a long time to start up .
2837	even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
3151	the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music , or copy large files over the local network .
960	as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
3146	this is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment .
127	it will read and play all cd audio disc .
1702	these include : mp3 , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma loss less ; . it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file ( s ) to be converted .
1850	3 . the nokia 6600 has a brilliant java interface .
778	the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
3414	ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is , and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved .
2193	however , the battery life is good enough you should n 't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
997	i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it ! .
3655	but this doesn 't make up for it 's innumerable other short-comings , the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate .
1025	i use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it -- no special `` diaper `` trash bags necessary .
3530	the fact that the `` 0 `` key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the `` # `` key instead .
1457	the micro seemed like an ipod for less .
3531	there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .
2325	these issues aside , the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one , you can 't be without one .
2527	at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my `` alias `` dvds as well .
910	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
1451	- great sound ! . i was very impressed , i encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great , especially with the better headphones .
88	it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .
2847	up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .
360	great picture quality - in automatic mode , quality is great .
601	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
1619	after installation , which was very simple . . . . i downloaded any updated software from the creative website , before i downloaded any music .
2797	1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
589	the earbuds that come with it are n 't that bad .
1128	from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3-1/4 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price .
2701	i left the camera in my car in maine ( not a very hot place ) and the lcd screen cracked ! .
211	four megapixels is great .
110	owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .
2733	it does n 't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n 't generally have firewire cards themselves .
377	i still can 't believe how fast it starts up .
418	good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro .
218	overall it is the best camera on the market .
1003	diaper champ is by far the best diaper pail ! .
615	another plus in my book , no file limits ! .
1185	also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn 't have any extra knobs or gizmo 's .
3576	i 'm probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software .
913	i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
270	very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
3014	now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will ! .
2706	the digital zoom is crap .
2932	it took several days of attempts before things finally `` worked `` again and i have n 't a clue why .
3366	3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
1438	you can use it as a storage hard drive .
556	another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
126	also , very light and portable .
3028	opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it .
302	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
1630	i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features : extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn 't an apple product with their proprietary architecture .
85	basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n 't used .
2571	first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .
2478	this dvd play is basically junk .
3721	but those 2 come up every time .
58	for the most part this is a good dvd player .
637	bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
3129	the electronic speed control is not doing it 's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will .
893	can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
1070	i ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because i change him so often downstairs .
3136	i even downloaded the product 's user manual - useless .
645	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
2251	ease of use/design : the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can 't figure this out , you shouldn 't even own one .
1376	absolutely no problems with this router .
2349	nis 2003 worked like a charm last year .
1845	i must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held .
1602	it gives you the most bang for your buck , period .
1471	i am now staring at an array of stuff including zen micro player , stereo earbud headphones , a rechargeable lithium-ion battery , an ac/dc power adapter , a usb 2 . 0 cable , a belt-clip , a stand , a stylish cloth pouch , an installation cd , a quick-start guide , and creative mediasource software .
2429	the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .
946	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! .
554	the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
3459	sometimes , various applications crash .
3267	while transferring songs to the player , the interface has crashed a few times ( 4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period ) normally this would cause me major concern , but it appears that this bug is reproducible , which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly ( or maybe it 's just my computer ) .
3737	if you are already using a previous version of nortron security and uni stalled it to install the new version , you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system ! .
633	anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
3190	) button sensitivity : even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting , the buttons are far two sensitive , really takes some getting use to , and even then , it is still too sensitive .
2160	the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
2469	the dvd player just would 't recognize them .
467	i discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure , white balance , flash ( red eye , person against bright background , flash on , flash off , flash automatic ) .
1285	i 'd give it 4 . 5 stars if possible , but since 5 stars would be misleading , i give it 4 stars .
1038	i have tried other pails , but none have compared positively to the champ .
3561	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n 't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
2262	plus , if you order from amazon . com , they will exchange it for you no problem .
2856	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n 't as easy as i would have liked .
502	i must say , i think this is the coolest camera i 've ever owned ! .
3565	when talking the voice is not very clear .
3456	on occasion i 'm not able to connect to the phone with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem .
845	you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .
265	i bought it for my trip to buns aries , and also used it at the iguassu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! .
3526	the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .
2803	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
1020	( we wrap them nice and tight ) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags -- cheap ! .
1508	the bass treble the sound detail is aw some .
870	the price / performance looked just right .
1994	as for bluetooth , no problems at all .
3369	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
3454	i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data .
1579	that 's it for now , what are you doing still reading this , click the `` add to cart `` button already ! .
2855	the headphones are n 't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
3285	after installation , the very first time i booted up the creative mediasource organizer , intending to use its cd burning and ripping functions , it totally shorted out .
2043	speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks ! .
3680	it 's a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus .
3403	styling/ergonomics : the keys are small , which generally doesn 't bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little 'braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn . must be paid when dialing .
3298	-user 's guide doesn 't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website .
2687	even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start-up .
1802	if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 ! .
3693	norton support is completely pathetic .
77	it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .
2984	the software , mediasource , can not work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2 . 0 , xp os ) .
2070	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
3221	even after all the nightmare sound problems , i 'd still half-way like this product if it kept it 's promise ; . the ability to store 1500 songs .
463	exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments ( i leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure , which goes a bit dark for my taste ) .
776	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
1118	1 . the diaper champ doesn 't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find ! .
744	usb 2 . 0 - very fast
1184	it came with a good fence that is simple yet precise and thats well made and won 't break .
580	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
2157	the phones are awesome .
2062	i am just in love with this phone , especially after using a more primitive phone about 3 years .
711	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
263	with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
864	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweaking with settings to try to make it great .
86	so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .
3333	why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20gb ipod that will hold 4 times the number of songs ( and even more if aac encoding is used ) for the same price ? . ? . ? .
576	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod ! .
2643	yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n 't like it too but no harm done since i always use the cam ea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n 't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; . that is what lamest exactly ot the picture .
2397	the program is fully featured , with much of what you 'd want from a security program --
1633	the zen micro is no exception : in addition to the case , it comes with a neck strap , and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging .
1963	camera quality isn 't bad for the low resolution .
1461	it was also the most appealing .
869	i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
122	good looks
162	with the automatic settings , i really have n 't taken a bad picture yet .
3472	for last one month my rebate status showing me that my rebate is approved and check is delivered but still i am waiting for check .
1707	it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
1967	i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal .
1062	there is no odor and it is very easy to use .
1629	this is really a no brain er .
797	while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
3518	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n 't there :
2816	the software failed repeatedly .
1997	this is the first cell phone i 've owned , and overall , i am quite pleased with it .
3202	the touch pad does take a little getting used to .
690	3 ) user replaceable battery
1298	a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years .
158	whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
3453	the os is ab it confusing at 1st , but within a few days you will pass this learning curve ! .
2231	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
603	best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
624	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
1745	it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
1348	well linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry .
3275	my other nit is that it didn 't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything .
3700	it was a symantec error .
1954	i highly recommend this phone .
3302	i 've read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now .
2369	by the way , i use the norton 2003 corporate at work with absolutely no trouble .
280	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
2898	navigation could be better , but there is n 't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
2598	* main dial is not backlit .
3127	you must keep double checking depths .
2878	the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n 't as easy as the ipod 's , or as `` sexy `` looking .
909	pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
1880	1 ) great audio quality overall .
1681	transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software .
3314	the headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of `` ear buds `` .
1366	feature wise , its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there .
1178	the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router .
2721	for example , in auto mode you can 't use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that .
3688	if you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product , save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version .
2753	it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
969	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
3614	maybe this new design is more durable than the last , but i kind of doubt it .
779	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
1072	it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all ( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife ) .
775	the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n 't take up space on your pc hard drive .
3018	even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast .
1711	the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
2977	the scroll wheel is finicky ; . it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; . new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; . some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
2396	it works better and has more useful features than nis 2003 .
2688	the flash is very weak .
968	the sound quality is very good .
114	but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .
2291	itunes can be downloaded from the enclosed cd or for free from the apple site .
2384	i 've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of skate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great ! . .
1036	first 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor .
2979	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n 't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
3296	whatever . . . on to the negatives : -touchy about charging . . . you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it 's life if you don 't upgrade the firmware or dont ' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side .
3613	battery : compared to the other players on the market , the ipod has one of the worst batteries around .
3365	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
618	i really have no complaints over this unit .
3478	sometimes when you press buttons , the menu appears after a second or two .
359	big lcd screen - at least for me , 2 `` is enough
2924	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
1220	the m12v has been great .
1149	the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well .
3686	if you currently own the 2003 version , and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version , don 't .
706	the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
2998	unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is `` player either not connected or busy . ``
1918	the ringtones are beautiful , the screen is super high quality .
1441	while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives , i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini , because i am not an apple person , never has been - i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player .
1840	this one is full of features ( has bluetooth ) .
1524	also , i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally ; . it is definitely an added plus .
226	it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
823	but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
2039	3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff .
2971	the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
1215	you just can 't go wrong with this one ! .
455	the color and light i captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to turkey ( gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques ) were far superior to anything i 've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera .
2212	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
720	although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
1029	great product , easy to use , economical , effective , absolutly fabulous .
222	great colors , pictures and white balance .
34	because of it 's hidden features ( no macro vision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
3046	too costly and not efficient if you ask me ! .
1324	the main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients .
2590	the one i purchased for a friend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .
2423	unfortunately it turns out to be the `` disposable `` type .
2014	i really love this phone . . .
3052	it still smelled .
2576	it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .
1951	this may be a really cool phone , but it 's not worth it with t-mobile .
916	the appearance is okay ed ( at least not ugly ) .
2682	not only is it inconvenient , but also the battery life span is short .
567	the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
115	the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .
785	not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
844	the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n 't be easier to use .
3323	the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies .
611	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
3135	too bad they don 't mention anything about how the cd can 't be used with a mac .
1571	i 've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces , and it still works flawlessly .
3736	i 've always liked symantec products , except for this version 2004 .
329	definitely a great camera .
305	in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! .
1491	it 's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though i haven 't had to do it yet of course .
966	honestly , i love this player .
16	for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .
3743	symantec should give us all a refund and apology ! .
2734	the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
2424	have had problems since the first day
2331	has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousands of songs and organizes them great .
2370	likewise , i 've heard norton 2004 professional version is fine too .
3701	after a recent update , i can no longer open more then 1 browser window .
813	the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
1799	i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
98	the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .
1639	on the whole , i 'm quite happy with the purchase .
1650	your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package .
2304	using the software itunes is relatively simple , you just plug the usb cable in , wait your machine to detect the ipod and voila , any songs listed in your itunes library will be transfer ed on over to the ipod .
839	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
1273	broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies .
1311	i got it working fast enough .
1736	sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening ! .
1325	linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding .
1518	while i 'm not too keen on their customer service ( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues ) , i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more . . . without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth .
1411	i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i 'm very happy with it .
3072	otherwise , get a smaller single speed router , which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits .
236	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
1902	as the 6600 uses 900mhz , it operates in more countries than the 6620 .
3377	the battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use .
630	i love this player .
2876	finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
207	i did n 't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! .
2567	it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .
2630	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
1339	my op ion is concentrate on what you need now , this product has excellent range , holds a teddy connection , ha sent even drooped one and i have it for more than a month now .
1779	i particularly like the `` txt `` file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take .
304	i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; .
635	i find it pretty easy to use . . . and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) . . .
1700	as far as user interface is concerned , the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player , 'creative mediasource organizer ' .
1302	anted to rate the router higher than 1 star , due to its security , easy of use , etc .
3257	- radio quality : weak reception
1615	overall though , i 'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player , even if it is to pretend your not a brain dead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod . ; . )
2171	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
364	i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips , i give it 5/5 stars = ) oh and btw , while you take video clips , you can zoom it too ! . ( digital zoom only though ) . . . but still . . . ( my old one can 't do that . . . you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip . )
780	playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
447	it will not replace your high-end 35mm slr but it 's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots .
2666	i took it out one day and the lcd was not working .
3490	a bit disappoint on that ! .
1651	five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums .
2090	this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
759	overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
2796	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
553	like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
3401	no matter how accustomed to the phone you become , too much time is required to get to , open and close applications .
2011	all in all , this is a great phone .
315	the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
703	the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n 't wash my car .
229	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the met 60 ct-4 .
1250	for the price i don 't think you can beat it .
3008	i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
1775	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
1732	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level ! .
3593	you can 't change the battery , so i don 't know what i 'm going to do in a year or so .
469	the panorama setting is unbelievable ! .
1287	just want a wireless router for home or your very small business , you can just get a wrt54g from here and configure it .
470	you have the option to have the flash automatic or off .
104	the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .
3674	i don 't know what 's happened to norton , but 2004 is absolute garbage .
2075	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
2676	the only thing i don 't like is the small size ( 8 meg ) memory card that comes with it .
1042	2 ) the champ uses regular store bags .
3430	unfortunately , i sold it exactly a month later .
2254	i have an ipod and it is a great buy .
1431	i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes ( no music i want , but thats just me ) and the creative product was cheaper ; . and i needed to be able to use wma files .
2366	the best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking .
457	i don 't believe this camera is still available . but if you can find one , you might like to get it .
1242	i use it on a router table , and it is works well .
2823	i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .
1384	i still need to read up on some of the security settings , etc to fully understand all that 's up there , but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the speed boost router .
3108	i sent it back , as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective .
1658	the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake .
2683	this isn 't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine .
698	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
2854	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
2270	firewire & usb2 . 0 -- for those fortunate enough to have firewire400 , your in for a real treat with auto sync .
2112	surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
73	remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .
736	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
504	second , it is incredibly easy to use .
1956	im able to keep my phone on for about a week ( mostly stand by ) to three days ( regular use )
255	the powershot g3 is a great camera .
3192	you have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost .
3579	doesn 't have alot of good games on it .
450	hate to wait between shots
2292	all in all , this is a wonderful device .
625	the battery is nice .
2951	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
3460	especially the bluetooth server . . . meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again .
762	simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
80	most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
326	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
1924	bottom line great phone for the time being .
2959	the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
1153	this is an excellent router for the money .
3036	the other pail i used started to smell after 2 weeks of use .
26	( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )
190	the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
3159	i couldn 't get the install wizard to work .
2110	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
1166	less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer .
1952	this phone is fantastic .
1862	it has great incredibility .
1690	otherwise , this is a great `` alternative `` mp3 player for those of use who don 't want to worship the mighty all-powerful apple .
2368	i 've used the corporate edition at work without any problems ever .
1980	but you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars .
13	at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! .
3316	within one month , my player completely died .
1191	i find that it is stable in my hands and its ' weight actually contributes to that stability .
512	i was looking for a compact , rugged ( i carry it hiking , skiing , boating , etc ) camera which is easy to use .
665	i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .
1235	the hitachi m12v is a dream to work with , smooth starts , adjustable speeds , micro-adjustable depth , and plenty of power to spare .
789	the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
522	the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance ( but there is no manual focus or manual exposure ) .
1767	battery life is ok .
362	digital zoom is clear too . . . say you used all 3x optical zoom , try to do digital zoom then . . . just try not to shake the camera at all and you 'll still get a clear good quality picture
593	i have n 't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
3371	2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
634	way less expensive than the ipod .
955	the screen 's large and easily read .
1819	1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .
2832	the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
816	this did n 't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
2574	in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .
1562	one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player .
3519	negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
745	but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
529	silver metal case -not plastic .
1151	it is heavy enough to make it stable , but not too heavy to preclude hand use .
3628	after 4 attempted installs , i have finally given up .
2719	i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture .
2852	the instructions that come with it do n 't explain how to make things simple .
3749	i tried disabling the various components provided with this product , paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service . . . and saw no improvement .
1688	two : it has a removeable/rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re ! .
649	i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
2545	so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it ! .
2485	i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .
1928	the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display , long rundown time and a good software suite .
2457	i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .
3446	it would not hang up on calls .
177	the camera has a wonderful set of features .
2059	it uses the extend able mmc memory , it is perfect for storing videos , pictures and mp3s .
2067	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
858	it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .
1182	i first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot .
1477	the zen lives up to the audio quality i love and expect .
982	it 's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn 't have clumsy and confusing ( not to mention expensive ) refills .
2208	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
3673	stay away from this product ! .
268	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! .
1214	for the price , i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup .
3286	i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work , to no avail .
365	photo stitch ( merge pictures to create a panoramic one . . even my old one can do this and it 's really cool to have it now still )
2916	i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .
95	it works great .
1293	the range is terrific , i am using this for my home and i was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard .
2445	this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .
2362	norton 's memory usage on systems with 512 mb is very low .
1351	the darn thing works as promised and it 's amazingly cheap too .
894	also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
3699	like most of their solutions ( which first blame other applications for errors ) , the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error - it was not .
366	turn the camera on while pressing the button ( or is it the menu button ? . i have to check again = ) ) and it 'l show you the time and date .
2439	it wo n 't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store bough ten .
1224	i did like the heft of the machine .
1837	if you are looking for an upgrade , this is definitely the phone for you .
2093	the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
3312	where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable ( and they included a second one free ) .
2	it practically plays almost everything you give it .
39	for the money apex machines have good features .
856	i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
2387	no more banner ads , pop-ups , and the reliable antivirus .
291	it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera . .
1035	it definitely keeps the smell out .
1201	the design of the col lets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craft man ( toy/junk ) routers i have previously purchased .
3051	that 's when it went from oder less , to odorous ! .
3093	i also removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise .
193	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
2900	however , i do n 't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n 't secure and the case can slip off .
602	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
2656	after reading reviews of lcd problems , cracked , black blobs etc , i figured that it was probably a very limited problem .
2318	everything else about the ipod is great , the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it .
2582	there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my perv . machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .
116	there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .
2401	so far , the anti-spam feature seems to be very good .
2609	maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
2754	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
518	the white-led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp , even in sunlight , and relatively easy on the battery .
1825	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
3196	the box included a little polyester , pull-string bag , ( yes , you read right a bag , something a boy would carry ten marbles in ) and tries to pass it off as the case .
181	i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
199	i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
2551	when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .
765	i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
3409	bluetooth does not work on this phone .
1374	the fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion .
118	i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .
1684	track # , name , artist , album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled , and properly categorized into the zen .
194	this camera has canon 's great calorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
3413	in short - nokia themselves don 't know that this phone doesn 't work with the palm , and if you don 't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts , chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly .
1979	the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with .
2182	in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .
93	amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .
1813	the battery recharges raul fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
3303	the touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don 't want .
2179	this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
1100	friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well , so bought the diaper champ based on on-line reviews and i have been happy with it .
766	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
3253	i 've since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers . . . not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable , but are too similar to ipod 's and can target ipod thieves here in nyc .
327	the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
2516	have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .
2739	the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .
3180	we bought this about 6 months ago and it 's been worthless .
1806	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
3110	the only not-so-positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment , it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately .
587	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
2747	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
209	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
1225	the power is incredible , it cut through md and plywood like butter .
748	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
977	we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it ! .
2334	they are extremely convent and you don 't have to buy them seperately has i-tunes , which provides quality music at low prices .
1268	another 5 star performance .
3461	this is somewhat annoying , but from working with computers ( especially windows -- ugh . . . )
2480	i tried called apex cu st service , no help .
2084	t-mobile was a pretty good server .
492	the s100 's image quality rates in the middle of its class , but it can still be a reasonable choice for students , families , or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack .
3246	while the software may not be as easy as i-tunes , it is not difficult to use by any stretch .
2622	got way too many blurry pictures .
1243	other than this , i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again .
998	the diaper champ couldn 't be easier to use .
1212	i use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems .
2441	i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! .
3444	also , when i dial an `` 800 `` number like an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu .
2158	we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
2510	the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .
3224	the only reason for not giving it 5 stars : the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player , but in real life i can probably get 6-8 hours at most .
2859	i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with `` bass boost . ``
3304	another problem is that the latest 2 . 0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads . charging [ -2 ]
747	it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
539	the optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom .
3582	the interface took a little getting used to .
1574	the menus are easy to scroll through ; . they are laid out naturally , and make sense .
1669	i 've had it for about a week now and have to say it 's one of the best purchases i 've ever made .
3310	still , that 's enough time that i 'm still satisfied , if a bit grouchy with creative 's over hyped promises .
1564	the touchpad is great once you get used to it , and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels ( as on the dell dj for example ) .
389	the instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep .
551	while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
1379	speed is not a problem .
3154	a couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet .
1634	the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus .
345	good image quality .
2633	( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
262	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
3447	once it froze so bad i couldn 't even use the power button to turn it off , and had to open and take out the battery .
3756	and i can 't warn you enough to stay away from norton ! . ! .
3661	as of october , 2004 , these products are not working and i 'm ready to demand a refund from symantec .
2145	small size .
922	with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
3532	the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
1111	we just recently had to buy another roll of bags . so $ 6 . 00 for a year of bags- can 't beat that ! . ! .
2060	its nice look is also a plus .
2237	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
534	i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100 , and of course i got the latter ! .
1019	*holds a lot of diapers -- a full week of toddler diapers ! .
2076	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
2435	i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggravation of getting the player to do it 's job .
3552	one complaint . . . the screen is too easily scratched ! .
260	i love the quality of the pictures .
1578	so far i have used all of the above-mentioned features , and find them well designed , and easy to understand .
2347	i rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism , but something about the ipod made me say , in the words of lou and andy , `` i want that one ! . `` i was willing to shell out
2230	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
2743	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
1553	creative did an awesome job with the design .
1789	great camera .
903	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
1312	it is a nice router in all ways but one .
821	i 'm really happy with this purchase .
3116	finally , i gave up and i purchased a router racier .
606	not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
509	at any rate , if you have been interested in digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back , consider the canon s100 digital elph .
460	i 've been incredibly happy with this camera .
2728	i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .
3175	was a bit wary because the software is windows only and i have an mac .
1353	the setup was a breeze , i had some reservations about a wireless network ( see my review for linksys wet11 ) but this item was on sale as well as the wet11 so i just had to splurge .
1863	the log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways .
3259	but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design .
3513	the vibration is not top .
3527	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
1041	it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers .
1588	the fit and finish of the product is first-rate .
1044	3 ) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months .
1357	a decent piece of hardware with great speed ( i get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem ) and good signal quality .
2738	the player itself has all sorts of problems .
704	longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
1995	i 've connected the phone with two laptops and a ipa 4155 .
647	it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .
3702	i 've searched the program and their online tech support ( worthless ) and have found no solutions .
3590	in addition , i do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours , and it can take four hours for a full charge .
2578	one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .
733	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
274	because this camera is beautiful .
324	all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
2983	i did n 't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .
1012	this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift .
2651	i thought given all the `` 10 `` reviews about this camera that i would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey .
2162	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www . crazy cellphone . com
2673	there were many times when i clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens .
1761	if you have to buy a camera on a bu get , this has got to be the one .
1512	fits well in hand in trouser pockets .
771	it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
3711	then , my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone .
248	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
891	7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
2249	sound quality : the ipod 's sound quality is pretty good .
2346	way to go apple ! .
1195	smooth plunging mechanism .
2556	the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ah wile .
1484	the sound is amazing .
3769	this time , it started the installation process , then i left for work . i think it will work . i hope it will work .
2727	only 1 problem , no accessories . . . yet .
3738	to install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called symantec or nortron , . . . also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted .
1505	built in microphone is great for recording short voice notes .
1395	creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature . .
3226	limitations : - not a lot of original accessories like the ipod .
688	1 ) price / gb of storage
1305	just follow the instructions carefully , it 's all based on a cd that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time .
1869	handsfree future is good , but not too exciting .
890	12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) ! .
1820	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
2840	controls are a bit awkward .
1330	the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up .
1935	nokia makes great phones , and this one is the cream of the crop .
2529	after two weeks the picture kept freezing .
827	* removable battery
3581	but i had to give you four because the service for my brand-new ipod was terribly slow .
215	takes excellent photos .
503	first , it really is tiny ; . the size of a pack of cigarettes , maybe a scotch deeper .
