    "The dataset we've chosen to focus on contains a few extranuous data and erroneous input, to include possible misspellings of counties, and missing information or other invalid data regarding population and crimes per capita. Cleaning will require the data to be processed in a step-by-step fashion consisting of: (1) planning, (2) analyzing to cleanse, (3) implementing automation, (4) append missing data, and (5) monitoring. Finally, we revisit our plans from the first step and reevaluate if priorities need to be changed, or if the rules we've implemented fit our strategy; the entire process will be done using functions and tools provided such as pandas dataframe, numpy, and math. \n",

    "*Data Analysis (1-2 paragraphs)*\n",
    "After cleaning, data analysis will be conducted using matplotlib.pyplot and numpy to more graphically express the consistency of crime rates before and after holidays in such a way that possible trends and progressions can be observed. Preprocessing steps will include careful analysis and log transformation to drop instances of outliers, such as unusually very high number of crimes per capita in some counties, and to normalize our data. Once we have plotted our data, we can proceed to find a best-fit-model that should allow us to detect and make predictions regarding consistency of crimes over the holidays in a number of different counties across San Diego.\n",

The location of the crime is listed but any information about the individual is not revealed except the sex of the criminal for certain crimes. \n",
    "    There should be no potential biases in our dataset since this data is off of SANDAG, the San Diego Association of Governments. This information should be purely 'fact' and not be opinionated at all. There is a certain jargon used to describe crimes and our data uses it. Our data should not be very problematic. Even though it may not be representative of the San Diego population, we want to see the crimes that occur in San Diego to help us determine if there should be more police officers out during the holidays. \n",
    "    There may be some issue with data privacy as the data does list the address, zip code, and sometimes the gender of the criminal for the crime. Knowing someone's gender and if they had committed a crime in a certain location can be easily identifiable, but we will have to double check with Safety Harbour as the data does not directly list out who that individual is, only the crime that was committed. We will handle this by anonymizing the data (removing the address and dropping the last two digits of the zip code). "

If our hypotheses are wrong, then we can assume that crime rate is lower or the same, depending on our results when analyzing crime after the holidays. Lower or static crime rates should not be enough to warrant investing into more security, but we also want to mitigate crimes as much as we can. The key is to allocate enough resources to match any bound that should be set on an \"acceptable\" number of crimes committed in each respective county.  \n",

Faulty results may also come from implemented functions dropping otherwise desired data due to the bounds we set for the upper and lower bounds of designated crimes when transforming our dataset to be normalized. Doing so would obscure our data the wrong way, making our interpretations erroneous.   "
